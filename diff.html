<br>President's Message--Causes of the War--Energetic Measures proposed.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , in the one thousand eight hundred and twelfth year of the Christian era , and in the thirty and sixth year after the people of the provinces of Columbia had declared themselves <span class="delete">independent of all the kingdoms of the earth</span> ;
<br>
<br>2 That in the sixth month of the same year , on the first day of the month , the chief Governor , whom the people had chosen to rule over the land of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>3 Even James , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Madison , delivered a written paper* to the Great Sanhedrim** of the people , who were assembled together.
<br>
<br>* President's Manifesto.
<br>
<br>** Congress.
<br>
<br>4 And the name of the city where the people were gathered together was called after the name of the chief captain of the land of Columbia , whose fame extendeth to the uttermost parts of the earth <span class="delete">:</span> albeit , he had <span class="delete">gone to the land of</span> his fathers.
<br>
<br>5 Nevertheless , the people loved him , <span class="delete">inasmuch</span> as he wrought their deliverance from the yoke of tyranny in times past <span class="delete">:</span> so they called the city Washington.
<br>
<br>6 Now , when the written paper was received , the doors of the chambers of the Great Sanhedrim were closed , and a seal was put upon every man's mouth.
<br>
<br>7 And the counsellors of the nation , and the wise men thereof , ordered the written paper which James had delivered unto them to be read aloud ; and the interpretation thereof was in this wise :
<br>
<br>8 Lo ! the lords and the princes of the kingdom of Britain , in the fulness of their pride and power , have trampled upon the altar of Liberty , and violated the sanctuary thereof :
<br>
<br>9 Inasmuch as they hearkened not unto the voice of moderation , when the <span class="delete">voice</span> of the people of Columbia was , Peace ! peace !
<br>
<br>10 Inasmuch as they permitted not the tall ships of Columbia to sail in peace on the waters of the mighty deep ; saying in their hearts , <span class="delete">These spoils</span> shall be given unto the king.
<br>
<br>11 Inasmuch as they robbed the ships of Columbia of the Strong men that wrought therein , and <span class="delete">used</span> them for their own use , even as a man <span class="delete">useth</span> his ox or his ass.
<br>
<br>12 Inasmuch as they kept the men stolen from the ships of Columbia in bondage many years , and caused them to fight the battles of the king , even against their own brethren ! neither gave they unto them silver or gold , but many stripes.
<br>
<br>13 Now the men of Columbia were not like unto the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain ; <span class="delete">neither were their backs</span> hardened unto the whip , as were the servants of the king ; therefore they murmured , and their murmurings have been heard.
<br>
<br>14 Moreover the Council of Britain sent forth a Decree to all the nations of the earth , sealed with the signet of the Prince Regent , who governed the nation in the name of the king his father ; for <span class="delete">,</span> lo ! the king was possessed of an evil spirit , and his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>15 <span class="delete">For the lords of the kingdom of Britain loved to dwell under the shadow of George the King , and under the shadow of George his son.
<br>
<br>16</span> Now this Decree of the Council of Britain was a grievous thing , inasmuch as it permitted not those who dealt in merchandize to go <span class="delete">whithersoever</span> they chose , and trade freely with all parts of the earth.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>17</span> And it fell hard upon the people of Columbia ; for the king said unto them , Ye shall come unto me and pay tribute , then may ye depart to another country.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>18</span> Now these things pleased the pirates and the cruisers <span class="delete">and all the sea-robbers</span> of Britain mightily , <span class="delete">inasmuch as they could rob with impunity</span> the commerce of Columbia <span class="delete">, under the cloak of British honor.
<br>
<br>19</span> Furthermore , have not the servants of the king leagued with the savages of the wilderness , and given unto them silver and gold , and placed the destroying engines in their hands ?
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>20</span> Thereby stirring up the spirit of Satan within them , that they might spill the blood of the people of Columbia ; even the blood of our old men , our wives , and our little ones !
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>21 Thus hath Britain</span> in her heart commenced War against the people of Columbia , whilst they <span class="delete">have</span> cried aloud for peace : and when she smote them on the one cheek they <span class="delete">have</span> turned unto her the other also.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>22</span> Now , therefore , shall we the independent people of Columbia , sit down silently , as slaves , and bow the neck to Britain ?
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> Or , shall we <span class="delete">nobly , and</span> like our forefathers , assert our rights , and defend that which the Lord hath given unto us <span class="delete">, Liberty and Independence</span> ?

<br>Reception of the Declaration of War in Great Britain--her friends in America--Caleb Strong--Hartford Convention.
<br>
<br>AND it came to pass , that when the princes and the lords and the counsellors of Britain saw the Decree , their wrath was kindled , and their hearts were ready to burst with indignation.
<br>
<br>2 For , verily , said they , this insult hath overflowed the cup of our patience ; and now will we chastise the impudence of these Yankees , and the people of Columbia shall bow before the king.
<br>
<br>3 <span class="delete">(Now the word Yankees was used by the people of Britain as a term of reproach.)
<br>
<br>4</span> Then will we rule them with a rod of iron ; and they shall be , unto us , hewers of wood and drawers of water.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>5</span> For , verily , shall we suffer these cunning Yankees to beard the mighty lion , with half a dozen fir-built frigates , the men whereof are but mercenary cowards <span class="delete">, bastards and outlaws ?
<br>
<br>6</span> Neither durst they array themselves in battle against the men of <span class="delete">Britain ;</span> No ! we will sweep <span class="delete">their stars</span> from the face of the waters , and their name shall be heard no
<span class="delete"><br>more</span> among nations.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>7</span> Shall the proud conquerors of Europe not laugh to scorn the feeble efforts of a few unorganized soldiers , undisciplined , and fresh from the plough , the hoe , and the mattock ?
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>8</span> Yea , they shall surely fall ; for they were not bred to fighting as were the servants of the king.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>9</span> Their large cities , their towns , and their villages will we burn with consuming fire.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>10</span> Their oil , and their wheat <span class="delete">,</span> and their rye , and their corn , and their barley , and their rice , and their buckwheat , and their oats , and their flax , and all the products of their country will we destroy , and scatter the remnants thereof to the four winds of heaven.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>11</span> All these things , and more , will we do unto this froward people.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>12</span> Neither shall there be found safety for age or sex from the destroying swords of the soldiers of the <span class="delete">king.
<br>
<br>13</span> Save in those provinces and towns where dwell the friends of the king <span class="delete">; for</span> lo ! said they , the king's friends are many.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>14</span> These will we spare ; neither will we hurt a hair of their heads : nor shall the savages of the wilderness stain the <span class="delete">scalping knife</span> or the tomahawk with the blood of the king's friends.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>15</span> Now it happened about this time that there were numbers of the inhabitants of the country of Columbia whose hearts yearned after the king of Britain.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>16 These men were called Tories , which signifieth , in the vernacular tongue , the blind followers of royalty.
<br>
<br>17</span> And with their false flattering words they led astray some of the <span class="delete">children</span> of Columbian Liberty ; for their tongues were smoother than oil.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>18</span> Evil machinations entered into their hearts , and the poison of their breath might be likened unto the deadly Bohon Upas , which rears its lofty branches in the barren valley of Java.*
<br>
<br>* Of the existence of this wonderful tree there have been doubts : but the reader is referred to the relation of P. N. <span class="delete">Foersch</span> , who has given a satisfactory account of it , from his own travels in its <span class="delete">neighborhood.
<br>
<br>19</span> And they strove to dishearten the true friends of the great Sanhedrim ; but they prevailed not.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>20</span> Moreover , Satan entered into the heart of one of the governors of the east , and he was led astray by the wickedness thereof , even Caleb <span class="delete">, the shittamite.*
<br>
<br>* Shittamite , in the hebrew , is applied to a dissenter :--perhaps it may be equally applicable here.
<br>
<br>21</span> Now Caleb , which in the Cherokee tongue , signifieth an ass , liked not the decree of the great Sanhedrim , inasmuch as he favored the king of Britain ; And , though willing to become a beast of burden , yet would not move on account of his very great stupidity.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>22</span> And he said unto the captains of the hosts of the state over which he presided , Lo ! it seemeth not meet unto me that ye go forth to battle against the king.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> For , Lo ! are not the fighting men of Britain <span class="delete">in multitude</span> as the sand on the sea shore ? and shall we prevail against them ?
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>24</span> Are not the mighty ships of the king spread over the whole face of the waters ? Is not Britain the " bulwark of our religion ?"
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>25</span> Therefore , I command that ye go not out to battle , but every man remain in his own house.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>26</span> And all the governors of the east listened unto the voice of <span class="delete">Caleb , the shittamite.
<br>
<br>27</span> Moreover , the angel of the Lord whispered <span class="delete">in</span> the ear of Caleb , and spake unto him , saying ,
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>28</span> If , peradventure , thou dost refuse to obey the laws of the land , the thing will not be pleasant in the sight of the Lord ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> Inasmuch as it may cause the people to rise up one against another , and spill the blood of their own <span class="delete">children.
<br>
<br>30</span> And the time of warfare will be lengthened out , and the blood of thousands will be upon thine head.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>31</span> And Satan spake , and said unto Caleb , Fear not ; for if thou wilt forsake thy country , and throw off the paltry subterfuge of Columbian Liberty , and defy the councils of the great Sanhedrim ,
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> Then shall thy name be proclaimed with the sound of the trumpet throughout all the earth ; and thou shalt be a prince and a ruler over this people.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33</span> Now the smooth words of Satan tickled Caleb mightily , and he hearkened unto the counsel of the wicked one :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>34</span> For the good counsel given unto him was as water thrown upon a rock.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>35</span> But when the chief governor and the great Sanhedrim of the people saw the wickedness of Caleb , their hearts were moved with pity <span class="delete">toward</span> him and his followers : yea , even those who had made a convention at the little town of Hartford.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> Neither doth the scribe desire to dwell upon the wickedness which came into the village of Hartford , the signification of the name whereof , in the vernacular tongue , appeareth not.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>37</span> For the meddling therewith is as the green pool of unclean waters , when a man casteth a stone therein.

<br>
<br>3 Lo ! If thou wilt give unto me two score and ten thousand pieces of silver , then will I unfold unto thee the witchcraft of Britain , that thereby thy nation may not be caught in her snares.

<br>15 Neither did the people , as Darius the Mede did unto the prophet Daniel , cast him into the den of lions , that they might see whether the royal <span class="insert">beast</span> would disdain to devour him.
<br>
<br>16 But they were rejoiced that power was not given unto him to command fire to come down from heaven to consume the friends of the great Sanhedrim.

<br>Hull's expedition--surrender of his army and the whole Michigan Territory--his trial and pardon by the President--capture of Michilimackinack.
<br>
<br>NOW the host of the king were few in numbers <span class="delete">;</span> nevertheless , they came in battle array against the strong hold of William.
<br>
<br>2 And when he beheld them from afar , he was afraid ; his knees smote one against another , and his heart sunk within him ; for , lo ! the savages of the wilderness appeared amongst them.
<br>
<br>3 And a rumor went throughout the camp of Columbia , and it bore hard upon William.
<br>
<br>4 Inasmuch as they said the wickedness of his heart was bent on giving up the strong hold to the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>5 Howbeit he was not taxed with drinking of the strong waters of Jamaica ; which when they enter into the head of a man , destroy his reason and make him appear like unto one who hath lost his senses.
<br>
<br>6 And when the charge against William was made known unto the soldiers of Columbia , they were grieved much , for they were brave men , and feared nought.
<br>
<br>7 So the officers communed one with another touching the <span class="delete">thing:</span> but they wist not what to <span class="delete">do.*
<br>
<br>* The officers present were not sufficiently numerous to warrant any opposition to the weakness of the general.</span>
<br>
<br>8 And they fain would have done violence unto William , that they might have been enabled to pour forth their thunders against the approaching host of Britain <span class="delete">;</span> which he had forbidden to be done.
<br>
<br>9 Moreover , the names of these valiant men , who were compelled to weep before the cowardice of William , are they not recorded in the bosom of every friend of Columbian <span class="delete">liberty ?*</span>
<br>
<br>* Miller , Cass , McArthur , Brush , Findley , &c.
<br>
<br>10 And it was about the sixteenth of the eighth month when the servants of the king appeared before the strong hold of Detroit.
<br>
<br>11 And the name of the chief captain of the province of Canada , that came against the strong hold , was Brock , whose whole force was about seven hundred soldiers of the king , and as many savages.
<br>
<br>12 Now when the soldiers of Canada were distant about a furlong , moving towards the <span class="delete">strong hold</span> ; even when the destroying engines were ready to utter their thunders <span class="delete">,</span> and smite them to the earth <span class="delete">,</span>
<br>
<br>13 William , whose heart failed him , commanded the valiant men of Columbia to bow down before the servants of the <span class="delete">king ;</span>
<br>
<br>14 And he ordered them to yield up the destructive weapons which they held in their hands.
<br>
<br>15 Neither could they appear in battle against the king again <span class="delete">in</span> many days.
<br>
<br>16 Moreover , the cowardice of his heart caused him to make a league with the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of the king , in the which he gave unto them the whole territory over which the people had entrusted him to preside ; notwithstanding it appertained not unto him.
<br>
<br>17 And the balls of solid iron , and the black dust , and the destroying engines became a prey unto the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>18 Now there had followed after William a band of brave men from the west <span class="delete">,*</span> and the name of their captain <span class="delete">was</span> Brush ; and he had in trust the bread and the wine which were to <span class="delete">support</span> the army of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>* Ohio
<br></span>
<br>19 And , lest they should fall into the hands of the savages , a captain , whose name was Vanhorn , was ordered to go forth and meet him.
<br>
<br>20 And the band that went forth , <span class="delete">was</span> entrapped at Brownstown , by the cunning savages , that laid wait for them <span class="delete">,</span> and the killed and the wounded of Columbia were about two score.
<br>
<br>21 And again there were sent from the camp of William more than five hundred men to go to the aid of Brush.
<br>
<br>22 And the name of the chief captain thereof , was <span class="delete">Miller*</span> and the captain whom he ordered to go before him was called <span class="delete">Snelling.**</span>
<br>
<br>* Col. Miller
<span class="delete"><br>
<br>** Col. J.</span> Snelling.
<br>
<br>23 Now Snelling was a valiant man , and strove hard against the men of Britain , and the savages <span class="delete">;</span> even until Miller the chief captain arrived.
<br>
<br>24 And the place <span class="delete">,</span> which is called Maguago , lieth about an hundred furlongs <span class="delete">distant</span> from Detroit.
<br>
<br>25 Now the battle waxed hot ; and the host of Miller pressed hard upon the savages and upon the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>26 Inasmuch as they were compelled to flee before the arms of Columbia : and Miller gat great honor thereby.
<br>
<br>27 And there fell of the men of Britain that day an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>28 Nevertheless , in the league which William had made , he had included Miller , and all the brave captains and men of war of Columbia that were nigh the place.
<br>
<br>29 Now , therefore , whether it was cowardice outright , in William , or whether he became treacherous for filthy lucre's sake , appeareth not unto the scribe.*
<br>
<br>* To palliate Hull's conduct it has been urged <span class="delete">,</span> that he surrendered his army to prevent the effusion of blood : but let us ask those charitable palliators what they would have said of Gen. Jackson , if , when a mighty and a blood-thirsty enemy appeared before his battlements , in quest of beauty and booty , he had given up N. Orleans and ceded the Louisiana territory to him ? or of the gallant Croghan , when left to defent fort Stephenson with a handful of men and a single six pounder ?--These palliators might even have wished that the heroes of Erie and Champlain had felt the same qualms of conscience :--but they ought to know that it was such noble deeds that stopt the "effusion of blood."
<br>
<br>30 But the effect thereof to the nation , was as a man having a millstone cast about his neck.
<br>

<br>
<br>32 But as it is written in the book of Solomon , There is a time for all things <span class="delete">,</span> so it came to pass , <span class="delete">afterwards</span> , that William was called to account for his evil deeds.
<br>
<br>33 And he was examined before the lawful tribunal of his country <span class="delete">,</span> and they were all valiant warriors and chief captains in the land of Columbia.

<br>37 But the infirmities of his age have weakened his understanding <span class="delete">,</span> therefore let his <span class="delete">gray</span> hairs go down <span class="delete">into</span> the grave in silence.
<br>
<br>38 And when James heard the words of the council , his heart melted as wax before the fire.
<br>
<br>39 And he said , Lo ! ye have done that which seemeth right unto me.
<br>
<br>40 <span class="delete">Nevertheless</span> , as my soul hopeth for mercy , for this thing William shall not surely die ; <span class="delete">but</span> his name shall be blotted out from the list of the brave.

<br>Hull's expedition--surrender of his army and the whole Michigan Territory--his trial and pardon by the President--capture of Michilimackinack.
<br>
<br>NOW the host of the king were few in numbers <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">,</span> nevertheless , they came in battle array against the strong hold of William.
<br>
<br>And when he beheld them from afar , he was afraid ; his knees smote one against another , and his heart sunk within him ; for , lo ! the savages of the wilderness appeared amongst them.
<br>
<br>And <span class="insert">there was</span> a rumor went throughout the camp of Columbia , and it bore hard upon William.
<br>
<br>Inasmuch as they said the wickedness of his heart was bent on giving up the strong hold to the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>Howbeit he was not taxed with drinking of the strong waters of Jamaica ; which <span class="insert">,</span> when they enter into the head of a man , destroy his reason and make him appear like unto one who hath lost his senses.
<br>
<br>And when the charge against William was made known unto the soldiers of Columbia , they were grieved much , for they were brave men , and feared nought.
<br>
<br>So the officers communed one with another touching the <span class="delstrike">thing:</span> <span class="insert">thing ;</span> but they wist not what to <span class="delstrike">do.*
<br>
<br>* The officers present were not sufficiently numerous to warrant any opposition to the weakness of the general.</span> <span class="insert">do.</span>
<br>
<br>And they fain would have done violence unto William , that they might have been enabled to pour forth their thunders against the approaching host of Britain <span class="delstrike">;</span> which he had forbidden to be done.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the names of these valiant men , who were compelled to weep before the cowardice of William , are they not recorded in the bosom of every friend of Columbian <span class="delstrike">liberty ?*</span> <span class="insert">liberty.*</span>
<br>
<br>* Miller , Cass , McArthur , Brush , Findley , &c.
<br>
<br>And it was about the sixteenth of the eighth month when the servants of the king appeared before the strong hold of Detroit.
<br>
<br>And the name of the chief captain of the province of Canada , that came against the strong hold , was Brock , whose whole force was about seven hundred soldiers of the king , and as many savages.
<br>
<br>Now when the soldiers of Canada were distant about a furlong , moving towards the <span class="delstrike">strong hold</span> <span class="insert">stronghold</span> ; even when the destroying engines were ready to utter their thunders <span class="delstrike">,</span> and smite them to the earth <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span>
<br>
<br>William , whose heart failed him , commanded the valiant men of Columbia to bow down before the servants of the <span class="delstrike">king ;</span> <span class="insert">king.</span>
<br>
<br>And he ordered them to yield up the destructive weapons which they held in their hands.
<br>
<br>Neither could they appear in battle against the king again <span class="delstrike">in</span> <span class="insert">for</span> many days.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the cowardice of his heart caused him to make a league with the <span class="delstrike">slaves</span> <span class="insert">servants</span> of the king , in the which he gave unto them the whole territory over which the people had entrusted him to preside ; notwithstanding it appertained not unto him.
<br>
<br>And the balls of solid iron , and the black dust , and the destroying engines became a prey unto the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>Now there had followed after William a band of brave men from the west <span class="delstrike">,*</span> <span class="insert">,</span> and the name of their captain <span class="delstrike">was</span> <span class="insert">is</span> Brush ; and he had in trust the bread and the wine which were to <span class="delstrike">support</span> <span class="insert">refresh</span> the army of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>* Ohio
<br></span>
<br>And , lest they should fall into the hands of the savages , a captain , whose name was Vanhorn , was ordered to go forth and meet him.
<br>
<br>And the band that went forth , <span class="delstrike">was</span> <span class="insert">were</span> entrapped at Brownstown , by the cunning savages , that laid wait for them <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> and the killed and the wounded of Columbia <span class="insert">,</span> were about two score.
<br>
<br>And again there were sent from the camp of William more than five hundred men to go to the aid of Brush.
<br>
<br>And the name of the chief captain thereof , was <span class="delstrike">Miller*</span> <span class="insert">Miller ;</span> and the captain whom he ordered to go before him was called <span class="delstrike">Snelling.**</span> <span class="insert">Snelling.*</span>
<br>
<br>* Col. Miller <span class="insert">and Col.</span>
<span class="delstrike"><br>
<br>** Col. J.</span> Snelling.
<br>
<br>Now Snelling was a valiant man , and strove hard against the men of Britain , and the savages <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">3</span> even until Miller the chief captain arrived.
<br>
<br>And the place <span class="delstrike">,</span> which is called Maguago , lieth about an hundred furlongs <span class="delstrike">distant</span> from Detroit.
<br>
<br>Now the battle waxed hot ; and the host of Miller pressed hard upon the savages and upon the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>Inasmuch as they were compelled to flee before the arms of Columbia : and Miller gat great honor thereby.
<br>
<br>And there fell of the men of Britain that day an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , in the league which William had made , he had included Miller , and all the brave captains and <span class="insert">he</span> men of war of Columbia that were nigh the place.
<br>
<br>Now , therefore , whether it was cowardice outright , in William , or whether he became treacherous for filthy lucre's sake , appeareth not unto the scribe.*
<br>
<br>* To palliate Hull's conduct <span class="insert">,</span> it has been urged <span class="delstrike">,</span> that he surrendered his army to prevent the effusion of blood : but let us ask those charitable palliators what they would have said of Gen. Jackson , if , when a mighty and a blood-thirsty enemy appeared before his battlements , in quest of beauty and booty , he had given up N. Orleans and ceded the Louisiana territory to him ? or of the gallant Croghan , when left to defent fort Stephenson with a handful of men and a single six pounder ?--These palliators might even have wished that the heroes of Erie and Champlain had felt the same qualms of conscience :--but they ought to know that it was such noble deeds that stopt the "effusion of blood."
<br>
<br>But the effect thereof to the nation , was as a man having a millstone cast about his neck.
<br>
<br>So William and his whole army fell into the hands of the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>But <span class="insert">,</span> as it is written in the book of Solomon , There is a time for all things <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> so it came to pass , <span class="delstrike">afterwards</span> <span class="insert">afterward</span> , that William was called to account for his evil deeds.

<br>Capture of the British frigate Guerriere , by the United <span class="delete">States'</span> frigate Constitution , captain Hull--capture of the Alert sloop of war , by the Essex , captain Porter.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , on the nineteenth day of the eighth month , that one of the tall ships of Columbia , called the Constitution , commanded by Isaac <span class="delete">whose sur-name</span> was Hull ,
<br>
<br>2 Having spread her <span class="delete">snowy</span> wings on the bosom of the mighty deep , beheld from afar one of the fighting ships of Britain bearing the royal cross.
<br>
<br>3 And the name of the ship was called , in the language of the French , Guerriere ,* which signifieth a warrior , and Dacres was the captain thereof.
<br>
<br>* The Guerriere was taken from the French by the British.
<br>
<br>4 Now when Dacres beheld the ship of Columbia his eyes sparkled with joy , for he had defied the vessels of Columbia.
<br>
<br>5 And he spake unto his officers and his men that were under him , saying ,
<br>
<br>6 Let every man be at his post , and ere the glass hath passed the third part of an hour <span class="delete">, her stripes</span> shall cease to sweep the air of <span class="delete">heaven.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And the yawning deep shall open its mouth to receive the enemies of the king.
<br>
<br>8 And the men of Dacres shouted aloud , and drank of the strong waters of Jamaica , which make men mad <span class="delete">; moreover</span> they mixed the black dust therewith.
<br>
<br>9 Now when Isaac drew nigh unto the king's ship <span class="delete">the people</span> of Columbia shouted.
<br>
<br>10 And Isaac bore down upon the strong ship of the king.
<br>
<br>11 About this time they put the lighted match to the black dust of the destroying engines , and it was like unto a clap of thunder.
<br>
<br>12 Moreover , the fire and smoke issued out of the mouths of the engines in abundance , so as to darken the air , and they were overshadowed by the means thereof.
<br>
<br>13 <span class="delete">(Now</span> the black dust was not known among the ancients ; even Solomon , in <span class="delete">all his wisdom , knew it not)</span>
<br>
<br>14 And the battle continued with tremendous roar <span class="delete">until</span> about the space of half an hour , when its noises ceased.
<br>
<br>15 But when the clouds of smoke had passed away , behold ! the mighty Guerriere lay a sinking wreck upon the face of the waters.
<br>
<br>16 The shadow of hope passed over her as a dream ; and most reluctantly was she compelled to strike the lion's red cross to the Eagle of <span class="delete">Columbia.</span>
<br>
<br>17 Whilst the Constitution , like Shadrach in the fiery furnace , filled her white sails and passed along as though nothing had happened unto her.
<br>
<br>18 Now the slain and the maimed of the king that day were five score and five.
<br>
<br>19 And the loss of the people of Columbia , was seven slain and seven wounded.
<br>
<br>20 After this Isaac caused a burning coal to be placed in the <span class="delete">ship</span> that she might be consumed , and the flames thereof mounted towards the heavens.
<br>
<br>21 And the great Sanhedrim honored Isaac with great honor , and the people were rejoiced in him , and they forgat the evils which had befallen them in the north.
<br>
<br>22 But when the lords and counsellors of Britain heard those things they believed them not ; it was as the bitterness of gall to their souls <span class="delete">;</span> for the pride of Britain was fixed upon her navy ; it was the apple of her eye.
<br>
<br>23 Now , as one evil followeth after another to the sons of men , so it happened that , in the same month , a certain strong ship of the United States , even the Essex , the name of the captain whereof <span class="delete">,</span> was Porter , sailed in search of the vessels of the king , on the waters of the ocean.
<br>
<br>24 And in process of time , she fell upon one of the ships of Britain , called the Alert , and made spoil thereof to the people of Columbia.

<br>Capture of the British frigate Guerriere , by the United <span class="insert">State's</span> frigate Constitution , captain Hull--capture of the Alert sloop of war , by the Essex , captain Porter.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , on the nineteenth day of the eighth month , that one of the tall ships of Columbia , called the Constitution , commanded by Isaac <span class="insert">, whose sir-name</span> was Hull ,
<br>
<br>2 Having spread her <span class="insert">white</span> wings on the bosom of the mighty deep , beheld from afar one of the fighting ships of Britain bearing the royal cross.
<br>
<br>3 And the name of the ship was called , in the language of the French , Guerriere ,* which signifieth a warrior , and Dacres was the captain thereof.
<br>
<br>* The Guerriere was taken from the French by the British.
<br>
<br>4 Now when Dacres beheld the ship of Columbia his eyes sparkled with joy , for he had defied the vessels of Columbia.
<br>
<br>5 And he spake unto his officers and his men that were under him , saying ,
<br>
<br>6 Let every man be at his post , and ere the glass hath passed the third part of an hour <span class="insert">the stripes of the Constitution</span> shall cease to sweep the air of <span class="insert">heaven ,</span>
<br>
<br>7 And the yawning deep shall open its mouth to receive the enemies of the king.
<br>
<br>8 And the men of Dacres shouted aloud , and drank of the strong waters of Jamaica , which make men mad <span class="insert">moreover ,</span> they mixed the black dust therewith.
<br>
<br>9 Now when Isaac drew nigh unto the king's ship <span class="insert">, the warriors</span> of Columbia shouted.
<br>
<br>10 And Isaac bore down upon the strong ship of the king.
<br>
<br>11 About this time they put the lighted match to the black dust of the destroying engines , and it was like unto a clap of thunder.
<br>
<br>12 Moreover , the fire and smoke issued out of the mouths of the engines in abundance , so as to darken the air , and they were overshadowed by the means thereof.
<br>
<br>13 <span class="insert">Now</span> the black dust was not known among the ancients ; even Solomon , in <span class="insert">the plenitude of his wisdom knew it not.</span>
<br>
<br>14 And the battle continued with tremendous roar <span class="insert">for</span> about the space of half an hour , when its noises ceased.

<br>Attack on <span class="delete">Sackett's Harbor--affair</span> of Ogdensburgh--British drove from St. Regis , by the Troy militia under major Young--the brigs Adams and Caledonia re-captured by capt. Elliot , near fort Erie.
<br>
<br>NOW the movements of the enemy were as the motion of a whirlwind , which passeth from the north to the south , and from the east to the west.
<br>
<br>2 And they sought to encompass the whole land of Columbia round about.
<br>
<br>3 So it came to pass that a number of the armed <span class="delete">vessels</span> of the king , that sailed on the great lake which is called Ontario , moved <span class="delete">toward Sackett's Harbor.</span>
<br>
<br>4 And they demanded certain vessels of the people of the United States , which they had taken from the king , to be given up unto them , saying <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>5 Verily , if ye give them not up , then will
<span class="delete"><br>we</span> lay a contribution upon you , and ye shall pay tribute.
<br>

<br>
<br>7 And when the vessels of the king were hard by , a certain captain whose name was Woolsey , set one of the engines to work.
<br>
<br>8 And the vessels of the king also opened the mouths of their engines and shot into the camp of Columbia.
<br>
<br>9 And the number of the husbandmen of the United States that flocked to the defence of the <span class="delete">Harbor</span> was about three thousand.
<br>
<br>10 And when the men of war of Britain saw that the people of Columbia were not afraid , and that they knew to use the destroying engines , they fled to their strong hold , in the province of the king , which is called Kingston.
<br>
<br>11 Howbeit , some of their ships received much damage from the balls of heavy metal , that smote them <span class="delete">,</span> from the strong hold.
<br>
<br>12 Now as the malice of the nations increased one against another , so did the evils increase which surrounded them.
<br>
<br>13 And it came to pass on the fourth day of the tenth month , there came a thousand fighting men of Britain to lay waste the village of <span class="delete">Ogdensburg</span> , which lieth hard by the river St. Lawrence.
<br>
<br>14 Howbeit , the people of Columbia permitted them not to come unto the land ; but compelled them to depart in haste.

<br>15 Nigh unto this place is a village which is called St. Regis , where the soldiers of Britain had come to fix a strong hold <span class="delete">,</span> on the borders of Columbia.
<br>
<br>16 But a brave captain , whose name was Young , with a band of men , called militia , went against them.
<br>
<br>17 And he <span class="delete">sat</span> the destroying engines to work , and the noise thereof sounded in their ears ; so they were discomfitted and fled in confusion.
<br>
<br>18 And the number of the servants of the king , made captive that day , was two score men , with the instruments of destruction in their hands.
<br>
<br>19 Moreover , one of the banners of the king , even the red-cross standard of Britain , fell into the hands of Young.
<br>
<br>20 On the eighth day of the same month , a captain <span class="delete">,</span> of Columbia , whose name was Elliot , a cunning man , took a chosen band , who came from the sea-coast , and put them in boats.

<br>22 And he came <span class="delete">unawares</span> upon the two vessels which were covenanted to the king , with the army At Detroit.
<br>
<br>23 And the <span class="delete">name</span> of the vessels were the Adams and the Caledonia , and Elliot captured them the same night.

<br>Battle of Queenstown--the British General Brock killed.
<br>
<br>AND it came to pass on the morning of the
<span class="delete"><br>thirteenth</span> day of the tenth month ,
<br>
<br>2 That Stephen , a chief captain of Columbia , <span class="delete">sur-named</span> Van Rensselaer , essayed to cross the river which is called Niagara , with his whole army.
<br>
<br>3 Now the river lieth between the Lake Erie and the Lake Ontario.
<br>
<br>4 And the noise of the waters of the river is louder than the <span class="delete">roarings</span> of the forest ; yea , it is like unto the rushing of mighty armies to battle.
<br>
<br>5 And the movement of the <span class="delete">falls thereof</span> bringeth the people from all parts of the earth to <span class="delete">behold</span> it.*
<br>
<br>* Niagara Falls.
<br>
<br>6 So Stephen gat his soldiers into the boats that were prepared for them , and they moved upon the rough waters of the river , <span class="delete">toward</span> the strong hold of <span class="delete">Queenstown.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And when the men of Britain saw them approach , they opened the engines upon them , from Fort George , <span class="delete">Erie , and Black Mock.</span>
<br>
<br>8 Nevertheless , they persevered ; although the strength of the waters , which were ungovernable , separated the army.
<br>
<br>9 However , Solomon ,* a captain and a kinsman of Stephen , reached the shore with the men under his command , in all about two hundred.
<br>
<br>* Col. Solomon Van Rensselaer.
<br>
<br>10 And he put the army in battle array , in a valley , and moved up towards the strong hold ; and Brock was the chief captain of the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>11 And from their strong hold they shot , with their mischievous engines , balls of lead in abundance ; and it was as a shower of hail upon the people of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>12 For there was no turning to the right hand nor to the left for safety.
<br>
<br>13 And Solomon and his men fought hard ; and they rushed into the hottest of the battle.
<br>
<br>14 And a captain of the United States , whose name was Chrystie , followed close after them , with a chosen band of brave men.
<br>
<br>15 So they pushed forward to the strong hold , and drove the men of Britain before them <span class="delete">,</span> like sheep , and smote them hip and thigh <span class="delete">,</span> with great slaughter ; and Brock , their chief captain , was among the slain.
<br>
<br>16 And Chrystie , and the valiant Wool , and Ogilvie , and the host of Columbia <span class="delete">gat</span> into the hold , and the army of the king fled : and Chrystie was wounded in the palm of his hand.
<br>
<br>17 But Solomon was sorely wounded , so that his strength failed him , and he went not into the hold.
<br>
<br>18 And that day there fell of the servants of the king many valiant men , even those who were called Invincibles , and had gained great <span class="delete">honor</span> in Egypt.
<br>
<br>19 Nevertheless , the same day a mighty host of savages and soldiers of the king ,* came forth again to battle , and rushed upon the people of the United States , and drove them from the strong hold of Queenstown.
<br>
<br>* Reinforcements from Fort George and Chippawa.
<br>
<br>20 For , lo ! Stephen , the chief captain , could not prevail on the <span class="delete">host of militia ,</span> on the other side of the river <span class="delete">,</span> to cross over.
<br>
<br>21 So the army of Columbia moved down towards the river to cross over again , that they might escape.
<br>
<br>22 But when they came down to the water side , lo ! they were deceived , for there was not a boat to convey them to a place of safety ; so they became captives to the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>23 Now the men of Britain treated the prisoners kindly , and showed much tenderness towards them ; for which the people blessed them.
<br>
<br>24 And the killed and wounded of the host of Columbia , were an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>25 And the prisoners that fell into the hands of the king , were about seven hundred.
<br>
<br>26 Nevertheless , in a letter which Stephen sent to <span class="delete">Henry*</span> the chief captain of the army of the north , he gave great honor unto the captains who fought under him that day.
<br>
<br>* Maj. Gen. Dearborn.
<br>
<br>27 And the names of the valiant men , who distinguished themselves in the battle , were Wadsworth , Van Rensselaer , Scott , Chrystie , Fenwick , Fink , Gibson , and many other brave men of war.

<br>And a captain of the United States , whose name was Chrystie , followed close after them , with a chosen band of brave men.
<br>
<br>So they pushed forward to the strong hold , and drove the men of Britain before them <span class="delstrike">,</span> like sheep , and smote them hip and thigh <span class="delstrike">,</span> with great slaughter ; and Brock , their chief captain , was among the slain.
<br>
<br>And Chrystie , and the valiant Wool , and Ogilvie , and the host of Columbia <span class="delstrike">gat</span> <span class="insert">, got</span> into the hold , and the army of the king fled : and Chrystie was wounded in the palm of his hand.
<br>
<br>But Solomon was sorely wounded , so that his strength failed him , and he went not into the hold.
<br>
<br>And that day there fell of the servants of the king many valiant men , even those who were called Invincibles , and had gained great <span class="delstrike">honor</span> <span class="insert">honour</span> in Egypt.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , the same day a mighty host of savages and soldiers of the king ,* came forth again to battle , and rushed upon the people of the United States , and drove them from the strong hold of Queenstown.
<br>
<br>* Reinforcements from Fort George and Chippawa.
<br>
<br>For , lo ! Stephen , the chief captain , could not prevail on the <span class="delstrike">host of militia ,</span> <span class="insert">hosts of militia</span> on the other side of the river <span class="delstrike">,</span> to cross over.
<br>
<br>So the army of Columbia moved down towards the river to cross over again , that they might escape.
<br>
<br>But when they came down to the water side , lo ! they were deceived , for there was not a boat to convey them to a place of safety ; so they became captives to the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>Now the men of Britain treated the prisoners kindly , and showed much tenderness towards them ; for which the people blessed them.
<br>
<br>And the killed and wounded of the host of Columbia , were an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>And the prisoners that fell into the hands of the king , were about seven hundred.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , in a letter which Stephen sent to <span class="delstrike">Henry*</span> <span class="insert">Henry ,*</span> the chief captain of the army of the north , he gave great honor unto the captains who fought under him that day.

<br>Battle of Queenstown--the British General Brock killed.
<br>
<br>AND it came to pass <span class="insert">,</span> on the morning of the <span class="insert">thirteenth</span> day of the tenth month ,
<br>
<br>2 That Stephen , a chief captain of Columbia , <span class="insert">sir- named</span> Van Rensselaer , essayed to cross the river which is called Niagara , with his whole army.
<br>
<br>3 Now the river lieth between the Lake Erie and the Lake Ontario.
<br>
<br>4 And the noise of the waters of the river is louder than the <span class="insert">roaring</span> of the forest ; yea , it is like unto the rushing of mighty armies to battle.
<br>
<br>5 And the movement of the <span class="insert">stupendous falls there- of</span> bringeth the people from all parts of the earth to <span class="insert">be- hold</span> it.*
<br>
<br>* Niagara Falls.
<br>
<br>6 So Stephen gat his soldiers into the boats that were prepared for them , and they moved upon the rough waters of the river , <span class="insert">towards</span> the strong hold of <span class="insert">Queens- town.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And when the men of Britain saw them approach , they opened the engines upon them , from Fort George , <span class="insert">and round about.</span>
<br>
<br>8 Nevertheless , they persevered ; although the strength of the waters , which were ungovernable , separated the army.
<br>
<br>9 However , Solomon ,* a captain and a kinsman of Stephen , reached the shore with the men under his command , in all about two hundred.
<br>
<br>* Col. Solomon Van Rensselaer.
<br>
<br>10 And he put the army in battle array , in a valley , and moved up towards the strong hold ; and Brock was the chief captain of the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>11 And from their strong hold they shot , with their mischievous engines , balls of lead in abundance ; and it was as a shower of hail upon the people of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>12 For there was no turning to the right hand nor to the left for safety.
<br>
<br>13 And Solomon and his men fought hard ; and they rushed into the hottest of the battle.
<br>
<br>14 And a captain of the United States , whose name was Chrystie , followed close after them , with a chosen band of brave men.
<br>
<br>15 So they pushed forward to the strong hold , and drove the men of Britain before them like sheep , and smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter ; and Brock , their chief captain , was among the slain.
<br>
<br>16 And Chrystie , and the valiant Wool , and Ogilvie , and the host of Columbia <span class="insert">, got</span> into the hold , and the army of the king fled : and Chrystie was wounded in the palm of his hand.
<br>
<br>17 But Solomon was sorely wounded , so that his strength failed him , and he went not into the hold.
<br>
<br>18 And that day there fell of the servants of the king many valiant men , even those who were called Invincibles , and had gained great <span class="insert">honour</span> in Egypt.

<br>4 And the words thereof pleased the young men <span class="delete">,</span> so that they went in numbers and joined Alexander <span class="delete">;</span> on the shores of the river which is called <span class="delete">the</span> Niagara.
<br>
<br>5 But here the hand of the scribe trembleth , his tongue faltereth , his heart sickeneth , and he would fain blot from his memory that which truth compels him to record ; for he is a living witness thereof.
<br>
<br>6 Alas <span class="delete">,</span> there was an evil spirit moving in secret <span class="delete">,</span> and In bye-places throughout the land of <span class="delete">Columbia ; and it was the offspring of tyranny , the cup-bearer of royalty ; Toryism.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And lo ! its viper-like insidiousness crept into the ears of the unwary husbandmen.
<br>
<br>8 For the sect of the tories whispered unto them , saying , Lo ! the laws of the land cannot compel you to step over the borders <span class="delete">of</span> the United States.
<br>
<br>9 Moreover , said they , the fierceness of the savages is terrible as the wild tyger , and their numbers as the trees of the forest.
<br>
<br>10 And the veteran soldiers of the king , who have been bred to war , are spread in multitudes over the province of Canada.
<br>
<br>11 Therefore , if ye go over to fight against them , ye will be as sheep going to the slaughter <span class="delete">,</span> and ye shall never again return to the house of your fathers , for ye will be destroyed.
<br>
<br>12 Even as the wickedness of the war , which the great Sanhedrim have made <span class="delete">,</span> against the king <span class="delete">,</span> cannot prosper , so shall ye fall a prey to the folly thereof.
<br>
<br>13 And it came to pass when the husbandmen heard these smooth words , many of them were bewildered in their minds , and knew not what to do.
<br>
<br>14 So when the young men who had flocked to the banners of Alexander , came down to the <span class="delete">water's</span> edge , to go into the boats , they thought of the words which the enemies of Columbia had spoken unto them ; and they refused to cross over :
<br>
<br>15 Neither could the persuasions of the chief captain prevail on them all to go into the boats ; and those whose hearts were willing were not enough.
<br>
<br>16 So he was obliged to suffer them to return to their homes ; for his expectations were blasted.

<br>Capture of the British frigate Macedonian , by Com. Decatur , in the frigate United <span class="delete">States--brig</span> Vixen captured by the British frigate Southampton.
<br>
<br>NOW it happened on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month , in the first year of the war <span class="delete">,</span> that a certain strong ship of Britain , that had prepared herself to fight a ship of Columbia , appeared upon the waters of the deep.
<br>
<br>2 And she was commanded by a valiant captain whose name was Carden , and the name of the ship was the Macedonian.
<br>
<br>3 And on the same day she met one of the strong ships of Columbia , the name of the captain whereof was Decatur , and the vessel was called the United States.
<br>
<br>4 Now Decatur was a man who had never known fear ; and the good of his country was the pride of his <span class="delete">heart.</span>
<br>
<br>5 And when he came towards the vessel of the king , he used no entreaty with his men , for they all loved him , and the <span class="delete">point</span> of his finger was as the word of his mouth.
<br>
<br>6 So when the ships came nigh unto one another , their thunders were tremendous , and the smoke thereof was as a black cloud.
<br>
<br>7 Nevertheless , in the space of about ninety minutes , the strong ship of Britain struck her red flag to the <span class="delete">simple</span> stripes of Columbia.
<br>
<br>8 Now the Macedonian was a new ship <span class="delete">,</span> and she gat much damage.
<br>
<br>9 But the United States , like the companions of Shadrach , moved unhurt upon the waters ; nay , even her wings were not singed.
<br>
<br>10 And the slain and the wounded , of the ship of the king , were five score and four.
<br>
<br>11 And there fell of the people of Columbia five who were slain outright , and there were seven maimed.
<br>
<br>12 Moreover the ship of Britain had seven of the stolen men of Columbia therein , who were compelled to fight against their brethren ; and two of them were slain in battle.
<br>
<br>13 And when Carden came on board the ship of Columbia , he bowed his head , and offered to put his sword , of curious workmanship , into the hands of Decatur.
<br>
<br>14 But Decatur said unto him , Nay <span class="delete">;</span> thou hast defended thy ship like a valiant man ; therefore , keep thy sword , but receive my hand.
<br>
<br>15 So they sat down and drank wine together <span class="delete">,</span> for the spirits of brave men mingle even in the time of warfare.
<br>
<br>16 And after they had eaten and drank , Carden opened his mouth , for he was troubled in his mind , and spake unto Decatur , saying :
<br>
<br>17 Lo ! if this thing which hath happened be known unto the king , that one of the vessels of Britain hath struck her flag , and become captive to a vessel of the United States , what shall be done unto the captain thereof ? for such a thing hath not been heard of among the nations of the earth.
<br>
<br>18 And Decatur answered , and spake unto Carden , saying , Verily thou art deceived , neither will harm happen unto thee.
<br>
<br>19 For , lo ! it came to pass , about <span class="delete">threescore</span> days ago , that one of the strong ships of the king , thy master , the name whereof was called Guerriere , fell an easy prey to one of the strong ships of Columbia <span class="delete">;</span> and they burnt her with fire upon the waters.
<br>
<br>20 Now when Carden heard these words , his heart leaped with joy ; for he dreaded the frowns of the king , and he was glad that he stood not alone in the thing.
<br>
<br>21 After this , in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth year of the Christian era , on the first day of the first month of the same year , and on the sixth day of the week ,
<br>
<br>22 The ship United States and the ship Macedonian came into the haven of New-York , having passed a certain dangerous place called Hell-gate <span class="delete">:</span> and there was a heavy fog that day.
<br>
<br>23 And there were great rejoicings in the city , and throughout the <span class="delete">whole</span> land of Columbia.
<br>

<br>Capture of the British frigate Macedonian , by Com. Decatur , in the frigate United <span class="delstrike">States--brig</span> <span class="insert">States.--Brig</span> Vixen captured by the British frigate Southampton.
<br>
<br>NOW it happened on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month , in the first year of the war <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> that a certain strong ship of Britain , that had prepared herself to fight a ship of Columbia , appeared upon the waters of the <span class="insert">mighty</span> deep.
<br>
<br>And she was commanded by a valiant captain <span class="insert">,</span> whose name was Carden , and the name of the ship was the Macedonian.
<br>
<br>And on the same day she met one of the strong ships of Columbia , the name of the captain whereof was Decatur , and the vessel was called the United States.
<br>
<br>Now Decatur was a man who had never known fear ; and the good of his country was the pride of his <span class="delstrike">heart.</span> <span class="insert">heart ;</span>
<br>
<br>And when he came towards the vessel of the king , he used no entreaty with his men , for they all loved him , and the <span class="delstrike">point</span> <span class="insert">motion</span> of his finger was as the word of his mouth.
<br>
<br>So when the ships came nigh unto one another , their thunders were tremendous , and the smoke thereof was as a black cloud.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , in the space of about ninety minutes , the strong ship of Britain struck her red flag to the <span class="delstrike">simple</span> stripes of Columbia.
<br>
<br>Now the Macedonian was a new ship <span class="delstrike">,</span> and she gat much damage.
<br>
<br>But the United States , like the companions of Shadrach , moved unhurt upon the waters ; nay , even her wings were not singed.
<br>
<br>And the slain and the wounded , of the ship of the king , were five score and four.
<br>
<br>And there fell of the people of Columbia five who were slain outright , and there were seven maimed.
<br>
<br>Moreover the ship of Britain had seven of the stolen men of Columbia therein , who were compelled to fight against their brethren ; and two of them were slain in battle.
<br>
<br>And when Carden came on board the ship of Columbia , he bowed his head , and offered to put his sword , of curious workmanship , into the hands of Decatur.
<br>
<br>But Decatur said unto him , Nay <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">,</span> thou hast defended thy ship like a valiant man ; therefore , keep thy sword , but receive my hand.
<br>
<br>So they sat down and drank wine together <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">:</span> for the spirits of brave men mingle even in the time of warfare.
<br>
<br>And after they had eaten and drank , Carden opened his mouth , for he was troubled in his mind , and spake unto Decatur , saying :
<br>
<br>Lo ! if this thing which hath happened be known unto the king , that one of the vessels of Britain hath struck her flag , and become captive to a vessel of the United States , what shall be done unto the captain thereof ? for such a thing hath not been heard of among the nations of the earth.
<br>
<br>And Decatur answered , and spake unto Carden , saying , Verily thou art deceived , neither will harm happen unto thee.
<br>
<br>For , lo ! it came to pass , about <span class="delstrike">threescore</span> <span class="insert">three score</span> days ago , that one of the strong ships of the king , thy master , the name whereof was called Guerriere , fell an easy prey to one of the strong ships of Columbia <span class="delstrike">;</span> and they burnt her with fire upon the waters.
<br>
<br>Now when Carden heard these words , his heart leaped with joy ; for he dreaded the frowns of the king , and he was glad that he stood not alone in the thing.
<br>
<br>After this , in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth year of the Christian era , on the first day of the first month of the same year , and on the sixth day of the week ,
<br>
<br>The ship United States <span class="insert">,</span> and the ship Macedonian came into the haven of New-York , having passed a certain dangerous place called Hell-gate <span class="delstrike">:</span> <span class="insert">;</span> and there was a heavy fog that day.
<br>
<br>And there were great rejoicings in the city <span class="insert">of New-York</span> , and throughout the <span class="delstrike">whole</span> land of Columbia.

<br>Affairs in the north--skirmishes--battle of Frenchtown , on the river Raisin--capture of Gen. Winchester's army--massacre of American prisoners.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , that the wickedness of Britain had roused up the spirit of Satan in the savages of the forest , in the north and in the west.
<br>
<br>2 And the tomahawk and the scalping knife were raised against the people of Columbia on the borders of the great lakes.
<br>
<br>3 So the people sought after a valiant man to go against the savages and the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>4 And they pitched upon a certain governor of the west , whose name was Harrison ,* and the great Sanhedrim made him a chief captain of the army.
<br>
<br>* Maj. Geo. , W. H. Harrison , Governor of Ohio.
<br>
<br>5 Moreover , he was beloved by the people , and a mighty host of husbandmen were ready to follow after him.
<br>
<br>6 And Harrison rested his army at the strong hold of Meigs , nigh the Miami Rapids , which lieth in the way journeying towards the strong hold of Maiden , which is in the province of the king ; whither he intended to go forth in the pleasant season of the year.
<br>
<br>7 And Winchester* was another chief captain that went against the savages.
<br>
<br>* Brig. Gen. Winchester.
<br>
<br>8 Now the savages had been a sore thorn in the side of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>9 They had assailed the hold which is called after a chief captain whose name was Dearborn , and their numbers overpowered it , and they used deceit , and put to death the men and the women and the infants that were found in the hold , after they had become captives , save about half a score.
<br>
<br>10 And their howlings along the dark forest were more terrible than the wild wolf , and their murderous cunning more dreadful than the prowling <span class="delete">tiger.</span>
<br>
<br>11 And the servants of the king gave them to drink of the strong waters of Jamaica , well knowing that they loved it as they did their own souls.
<br>
<br>12 <span class="delete">Yet</span> These were the allies , the messmates , the companions of the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain ! hired <span class="delete">assassins !</span>
<br>
<br>13 However , about this time there were many brave captains of the people of the United States that went against them.
<br>
<br>14 Even Russel , and Hopkins , and Tupper , and Campbell , and Williams , and others , who drove the red savages before <span class="delete">them.</span>
<br>
<br>15 And burnt their villages ,* and laid waste their habitations , and slew many of them ; for it is written in the holy scripture , Blood for blood !
<br>
<br>* Towns on the Wabash.
<br>
<br>16 Nevertheless , they treated the savage prisoners who fell into their hands kindly ; neither suffered they the people to buffet <span class="delete">them.</span>
<br>
<br>17 But it came to pass , on the twenty-second day of the first month , a mighty horde of savages and servants of the king , fell upon the army of Winchester the chief captain.
<br>
<br>18 And it was about the dawning of the day , when the destructive engines opened their fires.
<br>
<br>19 And the place where the battle was fought was called , in the vernacular tongue , Frenchtown , which lieth on the south side of the River Raisin , nigh unto Lake Erie.
<br>
<br>20 Now the name of the chief captain of the army of Britain was Proctor , and he proved himself a wicked man , and his name is despised even unto this day.
<br>
<br>21 <span class="delete">Howsoever ,</span> the battle waxed hot , and they began to rush one upon another with great <span class="delete">violence.
<br>
<br>22 And</span> The small band of Columbia fought desperately , and the slaughter was dreadful <span class="delete">;</span> and the pure snow of heaven was sprinkled and stained with the blood of men !
<br>
<br>23 Nevertheless , the people of the United States were overcome , and their chief captain made prisoner.
<br>
<br>24 So when Winchester found he was made captive , and that there was no hope for the rest of the men under his command , he made a league with Proctor , the chief captain of the host of the king.
<br>
<br>25 In the which Proctor agreed to <span class="delete">vouch-safe</span> protection to the captive men of Columbia , from the wrath of the savages , whom he had inflamed.
<br>
<br>26 Now the number of the men of Columbia that fell into their hands that day , were about five hundred ; and the slain and wounded about an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>27 And the number of the savages and the men of Britain who fell in battle that day were many.
<br>
<br>28 And Proctor removed the captives unto the strong hold of Maiden , which lieth upon the opposite side of the river , in the province of the king.
<br>
<br>29 But , in the cruelty of his heart , he left the sick , the wounded , and the dying to the mercy of the savages of the wilderness !
<br>
<br>30 In this thing he transgressed the word <span class="delete">of a man</span> , which is evil in the sight of the Lord.
<br>
<br>31 Oh ! for a veil <span class="delete">,</span> to hide in utter darkness the horrid deeds of that awful day , that they might not be handed down to the children of men , in the times to come.
<br>
<br>32 Lo ! early in the morning of the next day , ere the sun had risen , the work of death began !
<br>
<br>33 Behold the sullen savage , with deadly rage , drag forth the shivering soldier over the blood-stained snow <span class="delete">,</span> fainting , bleeding with his wounds , and imploring on his knees for mercy.
<br>
<br>34 Alas ! the savage understandeth not his words ; but giveth him a blow with the hatchet of death.
<br>
<br>35 For have not the counsellors of Britain said , For this will we give unto you silver and gold ?
<br>
<br>36 Thus were the poor wounded prisoners of Columbia slaughtered in abundance.
<br>
<br>37 And Round-Head , the chief captain of the warriors , and the savages under him , gat great praise from Proctor , the chief captain of the host of Britain.*
<br>
<br>* See Proctor's account of the battle , dated Quebec , <span class="delete">February</span> 8 , 1813.
<br>
<br>38 Neither did the sick and wounded escape , who had gathered themselves together in the houses , that they might be sheltered from the piercing cold ; even those who were weary and unable to go forth.
<br>
<br>39 For the savages put the burning brand to the houses , from which they could not flee , and burnt them <span class="delete">alive</span> therein.
<br>
<br>40 And the flames and the smoke arose <span class="delete">!</span> and their cries and their groans reached the high chancery of heaven ,
<br>
<br>41 Where they will stand recorded , until the coming of that day for which all other days were made.

<br>5 Moreover , he was beloved by the people , and a mighty host of husbandmen were ready to follow after him.
<br>
<br>6 And Harrison rested his army at the strong hold of Meigs , nigh the Miami Rapids , which lieth in the way journeying towards the strong hold of Maiden , which is in the province of the king ; whither he intended to go forth in the pleasant season of the year.
<br>
<br>7 And Winchester* was another chief captain that went against the savages.
<br>
<br>* Brig. Gen. Winchester.
<br>
<br>8 Now the savages had been a sore thorn in the side of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>9 They had assailed the hold which is called after a chief captain <span class="insert">,</span> whose name was Dearborn , and their numbers overpowered it , and they used deceit , and put to death the men <span class="insert">,</span> and the women <span class="insert">,</span> and the infants that were found in the hold , after they had become captives , save about half a score.
<br>
<br>10 And their howlings along the dark forest were more terrible than the wild wolf , and their murderous cunning more dreadful than the prowling <span class="insert">tyger.</span>
<br>
<br>11 And the servants of the king gave them to drink of the strong waters of Jamaica , well knowing that they loved it as they did their own souls.
<br>
<br>12 These were the allies , the messmates , the companions of the <span class="insert">soldiers</span> of Britain ! hired <span class="insert">assassins.</span>
<br>
<br>13 However , about this time there were many brave captains of the people of the United States that went against them.
<br>
<br>14 Even Russel , and Hopkins , and Tupper , and Campbell , and Williams , and others , who drove the red savages before <span class="insert">them ,</span>
<br>
<br>15 And burnt their villages ,* and laid waste their habitations , and slew many of them ; for it is written in the holy scripture , Blood for blood !
<br>
<br>* Towns on the Wabash.
<br>
<br>16 Nevertheless , they treated the savage prisoners who fell into their hands kindly ; neither suffered they the people to buffet <span class="insert">them !</span>
<br>
<br>17 But it came to pass , on the twenty-second day of the first month , <span class="insert">that</span> a mighty horde of savages <span class="insert">,</span> and servants of the king , fell upon the army of Winchester the chief captain.
<br>
<br>18 And it was about the dawning of the day , when the destructive engines opened their fires.
<br>
<br>19 And the place where the battle was fought was called , in the vernacular tongue , Frenchtown , which lieth on the south side of the River Raisin , nigh unto Lake Erie.
<br>
<br>20 Now the name of the chief captain of the army of Britain was Proctor , and he proved himself a wicked man , and his name is despised even unto this day.
<br>
<br>21 <span class="insert">And when</span> the battle waxed hot , and they began to rush one upon another with great <span class="insert">violence ,
<br>
<br>22</span> The small band of Columbia fought desperately , and the slaughter was dreadful <span class="insert">:</span> and the pure snow of heaven was sprinkled and stained with the blood of men !
<br>
<br>23 Nevertheless , the people of the United States were overcome , and their chief captain made prisoner.
<br>
<br>24 So when Winchester found he was made captive , and that there was no hope for the rest of the men under his command , he made a league with Proctor , the chief captain of the host of the king.
<br>
<br>25 In the which Proctor agreed to <span class="insert">vouchsafe</span> protection to the captive men of Columbia , from the wrath of the savages , whom he had inflamed.
<br>
<br>26 Now the number of the men of Columbia that fell into their hands that day , were about five hundred ; and the slain and wounded about an hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>27 And the number of the savages and the men of Britain who fell in battle that day were many.
<br>
<br>28 And Proctor removed the captives unto the strong hold of Maiden , which lieth upon the opposite side of the river , in the province of the king.
<br>
<br>29 But , in the cruelty of his heart , he left the sick , the wounded , and the dying to the mercy of the savages of the wilderness !
<br>
<br>30 In this thing he transgressed the word <span class="insert">he had pledged</span> , which is evil in the sight of the Lord.
<br>
<br>31 Oh ! for a veil to hide in utter darkness the horrid deeds of that awful day , that they might not be handed down to the children of men , in the times to come.
<br>
<br>32 Lo ! early in the morning of the next day , ere the sun had risen , the work of death began !
<br>
<br>33 Behold the sullen savage , with deadly rage , drag forth the shivering soldier over the blood-stained snow fainting , bleeding with his wounds , and imploring on his knees for mercy.
<br>
<br>34 Alas ! the savage understandeth not his words ; but giveth him a blow with the hatchet of death.
<br>
<br>35 For have not the counsellors of Britain said , For this will we give unto you silver and gold ?
<br>
<br>36 Thus were the poor wounded prisoners of Columbia slaughtered in abundance.
<br>
<br>37 And Round-Head , the chief captain of the warriors , and the savages under him , gat great praise from Proctor , the chief captain of the host of Britain.*
<br>
<br>* See Proctor's account of the battle , dated Quebec , <span class="insert">Feb.</span> 8 , 1813.
<br>
<br>38 Neither did the sick and wounded escape , who had gathered themselves together in the houses , that they might be sheltered from the piercing cold ; even those who were weary and unable to go forth.
<br>
<br>39 For the savages put the burning brand to the houses , from which they could not flee , and burnt them <span class="insert">to death</span> therein.
<br>
<br>40 And the flames and the smoke arose <span class="insert">;</span> and their cries and their groans reached the high chancery of heaven ,
<br>
<br>41 Where they will stand recorded , until the coming of that day for which all other days were made.
<br>
<br>42 Lo ! <span class="insert">these were</span> the helpmates of the mighty kingdom of Britain <span class="insert">,</span> that noble and generous nation , the bulwark of religion <span class="insert">!</span>
<br>
<br>43 Tell it not in Gath ; publish it not in the streets of <span class="insert">Askelon.*</span>
<br>
<br>* The whole of this massacre was conducted under the eyes of the British officers , and sanctioned by them as well as by their government ; this fact has never been disavowed.

<br>Capture of the British frigate Java , by the United States frigate Constitution.
<br>
<br>IN the twelfth month of the first year of the decree of the great Sanhedrim , on the twenty and ninth day of the month ,
<br>
<br>2 It came to pass , that one of the strong ships of the king had approached the country of the south , which lieth many thousand miles off.
<br>
<br>3 And the ship was called Java , after one of the sweet scented islands of the east ; where the poppy flourishes , where the heat of the sun is abundant , and where the Bohon Upas emits its deadly poison.
<br>
<br>4 Moreover , she carried about four hundred and fifty men , and a governor ,* and many officers and soldiers of the king ; and she was well prepared for battle.
<br>
<br>* Gov. Hyslop and suite , bound to <span class="delete">Bombay , in the East Indies.</span>
<br>
<br>5 And Lambert commanded the ship of Britain , and he was a brave and valiant man.
<br>
<br>6 So as he passed along , nigh unto the coast of Brazil , where the sun casteth the shadow of a man to the south at noon day :
<br>
<br>7 (A place unknown to the children of Israel , in the days of Moses)
<br>
<br>8 Lo ! one of the tall ships of Columbia , even the Constitution , beheld her when she was yet a great way off , and made signs unto her which she answered <span class="delete">not.</span>
<br>
<br>9 Which caused the gallant captain , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Bainbridge ,* to cast a shot towards her , after which she received the thunder of his destroying engines.
<br>
<br>* Com. Bainbridge.
<br>
<br>10 And it was about the second hour after the <span class="delete">midday</span> , when the sound of the battle-drum was heard.
<br>
<br>11 And as they approached towards each other the people shouted aloud , and the roaring of the engines was dreadful.
<br>
<br>12 And the servants of the king fought bravely ; and they held out to the last.
<br>
<br>13 For they were ashamed to let the nations of the earth say unto them ,
<br>
<br>14 Lo ! ye , who are the lords and the masters of the mighty deep , have suffered these <span class="delete">feeble*</span> Yankees to conquer you.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>* Anacreon Moore , by this time , it is hoped , is sufficiently convinced of the effeminacy of the Americans.
<br></span>
<br>15 Therefore , the slaughter was dreadful , beyond measure.
<br>
<br>16 And the black clouds of smoke arose , and obscured the rays of the sun , so that they fought in the <span class="delete">shade thereof.</span>
<br>
<br>17 And the winds moved the vessels about , and they strove to avoid the balls of lead , and the heavy balls of iron , that whistled about them in multitudes.
<br>
<br>18 (Now these balls , which were gathered from the bowels of the earth , were unknown to the Philistines ; even Sampson was a stranger to them.)
<br>
<br>19 However , the ships fought hard , for the space of about two hours , when their thunders ceased.
<br>
<br>20 And the ship of Britain had become a wreck , and the deck thereof was covered with blood !
<br>
<br>21 Nevertheless , the servants of the king struck not the flag of Britain ; for they were loth <span class="delete">,</span> and hesitated :
<br>
<br>22 But when Bainbridge , who saw this , came down upon them a second time , they humbled themselves , and drew down the British cross.
<br>
<br>23 And the slain and the wounded of the king , that day , were an hundred three score and ten ;
<br>
<br>24 And those of the people of Columbia , were about thirty and four.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , Bainbridge , the captain of the vessel of the United States , was sorely wounded.
<br>
<br>26 And Lambert , the captain of the ship of the king was wounded , even unto death.
<br>
<br>27 Now <span class="delete">, after</span> the servants of the king were taken from the wreck , and meat and drink sat before them , that they might be refreshed , they <span class="delete">regaled themselves ,</span> and were thankful.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>28</span> And on the second day Bainbridge put a match to the black dust that remained in the ship , and she burst asunder , and rent the air with a loud noise.
<br>
<br>29 And the fragments thereof were spread upon the waters round about.
<br>
<br>30 And the fish of the sea , even the mighty whales , fled from the noise of the <span class="delete">ship.</span>
<br>
<br>31 However , the Constitution escaped not unhurt , for she was much wounded in her tackling.
<br>
<br>32 So , when Bainbridge came into the haven of St. Salvador , which lieth farther to the south , he gave the men of Britain , whom he had made captive , liberty to go home to the king , their master.
<br>
<br>33 But when the tidings thereof reached the palace of the king , the lords and the princes and the rulers of Britain were confounded.
<br>
<br>34 Their spirits sunk within them : astonishment seized the tyrants of the ocean.
<br>
<br>35 The smile of joy had departed from their countenances , and the gloom of despair hovered around them.
<br>
<br>36 The wise men and the orators were mute ; they gaped one upon another <span class="delete">,</span> and wist not what to say.
<br>
<br>37 But the people of Columbia , from the north to the south , were gladdened ; and bestowed great honor and praise on Bainbridge the captain.
<br>
<br>38 Even the great Sanhedrim of the people rejoiced with great joy.

<br>Com. <span class="delete">Rogers'</span> return from a second cruise--capture of the <span class="delete">United States'</span> brig Viper--the General Armstrong and a British frigate--privateering.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , in the beginning of the one thousand eight hundred and thirteenth year of the Great Founder of the Christian sect ,
<br>
<br>2 That a strong ship of the United States , called the President , commanded by <span class="delete">Rogers</span> , returned a second time to the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>3 And while she was upon the waters of the great deep , she fell in with one of the packets of the king <span class="delete">,</span> called after the <span class="delete">swift-flying</span> bird* of the air , and made capture thereof.
<br>
<br>* Swallow.
<br>
<br>4 And in the ship <span class="delete">Rogers</span> found abundance of <span class="delete">wealth ;</span> even an hundred , sixty and eight thousand pieces of silver.
<br>
<br>5 And it was carried , with many horses , to a place of safe-keeping ,* in the town of Boston , which lieth to the east.
<br>
<br>* <span class="delete">State</span> Bank of Boston.
<br>
<br>6 Moreover , he made capture of another ship of the king ,* laden with oil and bones of the great fish of the deep.
<br>
<br>* Ship Argo.
<br>
<br>7 Now it happened , on the seventeenth day of the first month of the same year ,
<br>
<br>8 That one of the weak vessels of the United <span class="delete">States ,*</span> became a prey to one of the strong ships of the king <span class="delete">,</span> called the Narcissus <span class="delete">; albeit</span> she fought not.
<br>
<br>* <span class="delete">United States' brig</span> Viper.
<br>
<br>9 About this time the great waters of the Chesapeake , which empty into the sea , were guarded by the strong ships of the king , so that the vessels might not arrive or depart therefrom.
<br>
<br>10 But the vessels of the United States , and the private vessels of the men of Columbia , were doing great damage unto the commerce of Britain , even in her own waters.
<br>
<br>11 And the number of the private vessels that moved swiftly over the face of the waters , and went out to despoil the commerce of Britain , and <span class="delete">make capture</span> merchant vessels thereof , was about two hundred <span class="delete">, two
<br>score</span> and ten.
<br>
<br>12 And they made capture of more than fifteen hundred of the vessels of the people of Britain.*
<br>
<br>* During the war.
<br>
<br>13 Moreover <span class="delete">,</span> there was a sore battle between one of the private armed vessels of the people of the United States , and a strong ship of the king.*
<br>
<br>* A British frigate.
<br>
<br>14 The privateer was called the General Armstrong <span class="delete">,</span> and the name of the captain was Guy.*
<br>
<br>* Capt. <span class="delete">Champlin.</span>
<br>
<br>15 Now Guy was a valiant man , and fear was a stranger to him.
<br>
<br>16 And on the eleventh day of the third month <span class="delete">,</span> he espied from afar a vessel which appeared as a speck upon the waters.
<br>
<br>17 But when he bore down upon her , behold ! She was a fighting ship of Britain , carrying the destroying engines.
<br>
<br>18 And Guy was <span class="delete">nigh</span> being entrapped , for he was deceived , thinking it <span class="delete">a merchant's ship.</span>
<br>
<br>19 Therefore he was compelled to fight <span class="delete">,</span> so he opened upon the vessel of the king one of his mischievous engines called , in the vernacular tongue , Long-Tom.
<br>
<br>20 And they fought hard , and the noise of the engines was very great.
<br>
<br>21 And the balls of lead and iron showered around like hail-stones ; for the strong ship of Britain had them in abundance.
<br>
<br>22 Now the slaughter was dreadful on both sides , and Guy was <span class="delete">nigh</span> making capture of the ship : but he received a wound and his vessel was disabled , so he made good his escape.
<br>
<br>23 And the slain and the wounded of Guy were twenty and three , and the vessel of the king lost about twice that number.
<br>
<br>24 Now , for this valiant act , Guy gat great honor , and the people <span class="delete">gave</span> him a sword of <span class="delete">curious</span> workmanship.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , the Saratoga , the Scourge , the Chasseur , and many other private vessels of the people of the United States , were a grievous plague to the servants of the king ;
<br>
<br>26 Inasmuch as some of them made sport with the mighty blockade of Britain , which she put forth against the free people of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>27 For when they came nigh unto the coast of Britain , they made capture and burnt the vessels of the king , that carried rich merchandise , costly jewels , and silver and gold.
<br>
<br>28 Yea , even in their own waters , and in the sight of their own havens , did they do these things.
<br>
<br>29 For it happened that the cunning Yankees knew how to construct the swift-sailing vessels , that they out-ran the strong vessels of Britain.
<br>
<br>30 And as the ships of Britain moved but slowly on the waters , so they caught them not.
<br>
<br>31 Wherefore the artificers , the mechanics , and those who dealt in merchandise , raised their voices to the great council of Britain , saying ,
<br>
<br>32 Lo ! are we not the faithful servants of the king , our master ? have we not given unto him the one half of our whole substance ? and shall these Yankees take from us the remainder ?
<br>
<br>33 Hath not the king a thousand ships of war ? and wherefore should we be hemmed in ?
<br>
<br>34 Lo ! our merchant vessels are idle ! neither can we pass in safety even unto the land of Hibernia , which lieth nigh unto us.
<br>
<br>35 And , behold , the captain of a private armed vessel of the Yankees , in derision of the proclamation of our lord the king , hath proclaimed the island of Great Britain and her dependencies in a state of <span class="delete">rigorous</span> blockade ; saying , Lo ! I have the power to
<span class="delete"><br>hem ye in ;</span>
<br>
<br>36 Therefore , let the counsellors of the king ponder these things , and let the strong ships of Britain drive the vessels of Columbia from our coast.
<br>
<br>37 Now the wise men of Britain heard those things with sorrow ; and they spake one to another concerning the matter :
<br>
<br>38 But they wist not what to do ; for the cunning of the captains of the fast sailing vessels of Columbia , surpassed the wisdom of the lords of Britain.

<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , in the beginning of the one thousand eight hundred and thirteenth year of the Great Founder of the Christian sect ,
<br>
<br>That a strong ship of the United States , called the President , commanded by <span class="delstrike">Rogers</span> <span class="insert">Rodgers</span> , returned a second time to the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>And while she was upon the waters of the great deep , she fell in with one of the packets of the king <span class="delstrike">,</span> called after the <span class="delstrike">swift-flying</span> <span class="insert">swift flying</span> bird* of the air , and made capture thereof.
<br>
<br>* Swallow.
<br>
<br>And in the ship <span class="delstrike">Rogers</span> <span class="insert">Rodgers</span> found abundance of <span class="delstrike">wealth ;</span> <span class="insert">wealthy</span> even an hundred , sixty and eight thousand pieces of silver.
<br>
<br>And it was carried , with many horses , to a place of safe-keeping ,* in the town of Boston , which lieth to the east.
<br>
<br>* <span class="delstrike">State</span> Bank of Boston.
<br>
<br>Moreover , he made capture of another ship of the king ,* laden with oil and bones of the great fish of the deep.
<br>
<br>* Ship Argo.
<br>
<br>Now it happened , on the seventeenth day of the first month of the same year ,
<br>
<br>That one of the weak vessels of the United <span class="delstrike">States ,*</span> <span class="insert">States*</span> became a prey to one of the strong ships of the king <span class="delstrike">,</span> called the Narcissus <span class="delstrike">; albeit</span> <span class="insert">: albeit ,</span> she fought not.
<br>
<br>* <span class="delstrike">United States' brig</span> Viper.
<br>
<br>About this time the great waters of the Chesapeake , which empty into the sea , were guarded by the strong ships of the king , so that the vessels might not arrive or depart therefrom.
<br>
<br>But the vessels of the United States , and the private vessels of the men of Columbia , were doing great damage unto the commerce of Britain , even in her own waters.
<br>
<br>And the number of the private vessels <span class="insert">,</span> that moved swiftly over the face of the waters , and went out to despoil the commerce of Britain , and <span class="delstrike">make capture</span> <span class="insert">to capture the</span> merchant vessels thereof , was about two hundred <span class="delstrike">, two
<br>score</span> <span class="insert">two score</span> and ten.
<br>
<br>And they made capture of more than fifteen hundred of the vessels of the people of Britain.*
<br>
<br>* During the war.
<br>
<br>Moreover <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> there was a sore battle between one of the private armed vessels of the people of the United <span class="insert">;</span> States , and a strong ship of the king.*
<br>
<br>* A British frigate.
<br>
<br>The privateer was called the General Armstrong <span class="delstrike">,</span> and the name of the captain was Guy.*
<br>
<br>* Capt. <span class="delstrike">Champlin.</span> <span class="insert">Champlain.</span>
<br>
<br>Now Guy was a valiant man , and fear was a stranger to him. <span class="insert">.</span>
<br>
<br>And on the eleventh day of the third month <span class="delstrike">,</span> he espied from afar a vessel which appeared as a speck upon the waters.
<br>
<br>But when he bore down upon her , behold ! She was a fighting ship of Britain , carrying the destroying engines.
<br>
<br>And Guy was <span class="delstrike">nigh</span> <span class="insert">near</span> being entrapped , for he was deceived , thinking it <span class="delstrike">a merchant's ship.</span> <span class="insert">was a merchant's vessel.</span>
<br>
<br>Therefore he was compelled to fight <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> so he opened upon the vessel of the king <span class="insert">,</span> one of his mischievous engines called , in the vernacular tongue , Long-Tom.
<br>
<br>And they fought hard , and the noise of the engines was very great.
<br>
<br>And the balls of lead and iron showered around like hail-stones ; for the strong ship of Britain had them in abundance.
<br>
<br>Now the slaughter was dreadful on both sides , and Guy was <span class="delstrike">nigh</span> <span class="insert">on the point of</span> making capture of the ship : but he received a wound <span class="insert">,</span> and his vessel was disabled , so he made good his escape.
<br>
<br>And the slain and the wounded of Guy were twenty and three , and the vessel of the king lost about twice that number.
<br>
<br>Now , for this valiant act , Guy gat great honor , and the people <span class="delstrike">gave</span> <span class="insert">give</span> him a sword of <span class="delstrike">curious</span> <span class="insert">fine</span> workmanship.

<br>Capture of the Peacock , of 18 guns , by the U. S. sloop of war Hornet , of 16 guns--return of the Chesapeake from a cruise.
<br>
<br>THE deeds of the renowned warriors , the patriots , and the valiant men of Columbia , have prepared a path for the scribe , which he is compelled to <span class="delete">follow.</span>
<br>
<br>2 But , as the soaring eagle moves to its craggy nest , or the cooing dove to its tender mate , so is the compulsion of his heart.
<br>
<br>3 If the wickedness of Britain hath made manifest her folly <span class="delete">;</span> if her sons have sat down in sackcloth and ashes , the scribe looketh down upon her with pity.
<br>
<br>4 It is written that , He who prideth himself in his strength shall be humbled ; and the haughty shall be brought low.
<br>
<br>5 And , if the Lord hath smiled upon the arms of Columbia , let no man frown.
<br>
<br>6 Now it came to pass , in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth year of the Christian era , on the twenty-fourth day of the second month ,
<br>
<br>7 That one of the fighting vessels of Columbia , called the Hornet , which signifieth , in the vernacular tongue <span class="delete">,</span> a fly whose sting is poison ,
<br>
<br>8 Moved upon the <span class="delete">great</span> waters of the deep , far to the south , <span class="delete">nigh</span> unto a place which is called Demarara.
<br>
<br>9 Moreover , the captain of the Hornet was a valiant man , and his name was Lawrence.
<br>
<br>10 And it was towards the setting of the sun , when he came nigh unto one of the strong ships of the king <span class="delete">,</span> called the Peacock , after the bird whose feathers are beautiful to behold ;
<br>
<br>11 And the captain thereof was <span class="delete">sur-named</span> Peake.
<br>
<br>12 Now began the roaring noises of the engines of destruction , that opened their mouths against one another ; and dreadful was the slaughter of that day.
<br>
<br>13 Nevertheless , in the space of about the fourth part of an hour the vessel of the king captured by the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>14 And they found therein some of the mariners of the United States , who had begged that they might go down into the hold of the ship , and not raise their hands against the blood of their own brethren :
<br>
<br>15 But Peake , the commander , suffered them not , but compelled them to fight against their own kinsmen <span class="delete">;</span> and one of them was slain in battle.
<br>
<br>16 And the killed and maimed of the people of Britain , were about two score and two <span class="delete">; and Peake ,</span> the captain , was also slain : and the loss of Columbia was about five souls !
<br>
<br>17 Moreover , the Peacock sunk down into the yawning deep , before they could get all the men of Britain out of her ; and three of the people of Columbia were buried with her , whilst in the humane act of <span class="delete">endeavoring</span> to preserve the lives of the <span class="delete">enemy.</span>
<br>
<br>18 Now this was the fifth fighting vessel of the king which had been humbled , since the decree of the great Sanhedrim , before the destroying engines of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>19 And Lawrence , and the brave men that fought <span class="delete">under</span> him , had honor and praise poured out upon them abundantly.
<br>
<br>20 Moreover the people of New-York gave unto Lawrence vessels of silver , with curious devices ; and they made a feast for the men who fought in the Hornet.
<br>
<br>21 And all the people were exceedingly rejoiced at the valiant acts of Lawrence , and his fame extended throughout the land of Columbia ; the sound of his name was the joy of <span class="delete">the</span> heart.
<br>
<br>22 But when the news thereof reached the ears of the wise men of Britain , they said , Lo ! these men are giants ; neither are they like unto the warriors of the king.
<br>

<br>THE deeds of the renowned warriors , the patriots , and the valiant men of Columbia , have prepared a path for the scribe , which he is compelled to <span class="delstrike">follow.</span> <span class="insert">follow :</span>

<br>It is written that , He who prideth himself in his strength shall be humbled ; and the haughty shall be brought low.
<br>
<br>And , if the Lord hath smiled upon the arms of Columbia , let no man frown.
<br>
<br>Now it came to pass , in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth year of the Christian era , on the twenty-fourth day of the second month ,
<br>
<br>That one of the fighting vessels of Columbia , called the Hornet , which signifieth , in the vernacular tongue <span class="delstrike">,</span> a fly whose sting is poison ,
<br>
<br>Moved upon the <span class="delstrike">great</span> waters of the <span class="insert">great</span> deep , far to the south , <span class="delstrike">nigh</span> <span class="insert">near</span> unto a place which is called Demarara.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the captain of the Hornet was a valiant man , and his name was Lawrence.
<br>
<br>And it was towards the setting of the sun , when he came nigh unto one of the strong ships of the king <span class="delstrike">,</span> called the Peacock , after <span class="insert">,</span> the bird whose feathers are beautiful to behold ;
<br>
<br>And the captain thereof was <span class="delstrike">sur-named</span> <span class="insert">sir-named</span> Peake.
<br>
<br>Now began the roaring noises of the engines of destruction , that opened their mouths against one another ; and dreadful was the slaughter of that day.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , in the space of about the fourth part of an hour <span class="insert">,</span> the vessel of the king <span class="insert">was</span> captured by the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>And they found therein some of the mariners of the United States , who had begged that they might go down into the hold of the ship , and not raise their hands against the blood of their own brethren :
<br>
<br>But Peake , the commander , suffered them not , but compelled them to fight against their own kinsmen <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">:</span> and one of them was slain in battle.
<br>
<br>And the killed and maimed of the people of Britain , were about two score and two <span class="delstrike">; and Peake ,</span> <span class="insert">: and Peake</span> the captain , was also slain : and the loss of Columbia was about five souls !
<br>
<br>Moreover , the Peacock sunk down into the yawning deep , before they could get all the men of Britain out of her ; and three of the people of Columbia were buried with her , whilst in the humane act of <span class="delstrike">endeavoring</span> <span class="insert">endeavouring</span> to preserve the lives of the <span class="delstrike">enemy.</span> <span class="insert">enemy ,</span>
<br>
<br>Now this was the fifth fighting vessel of the king <span class="insert">.</span> which had been humbled , since the decree of the great Sanhedrim , before the destroying engines of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>And Lawrence , and the brave men that fought <span class="delstrike">under</span> <span class="insert">with</span> him , had honor and praise poured out upon them abundantly.
<br>
<br>Moreover <span class="insert">,</span> the people of New-York gave unto Lawrence vessels of silver , with curious devices ; and they made a feast for the men who fought in the Hornet.
<br>
<br>And all the people were exceedingly rejoiced at the valiant acts of Lawrence , and his fame extended throughout the land of Columbia ; the sound of his name was the joy of <span class="delstrike">the</span> <span class="insert">every</span> heart.
<br>
<br>But when the news thereof reached the ears of the wise men of Britain , they said , Lo ! these men are giants ; neither are they like unto the warriors of the king.
<br>
<br>And their witchcraft and their cunning are darkness unto us ; even as when a man putteth a candle under a bushel.

<br>Capture of little York , in Upper Canada--the destruction of the whole American army prevented by the precaution of Gen. Pike--his death.
<br>
<br>NOW , <span class="delete">while</span> these things happened in the south , and the evils of war destroyed the life of man , and the smiles of heaven strengthened the arms , and lifted up the glory of <span class="delete">Columbia</span> ;
<br>
<br>2 Behold , preparations of warfare were making on the borders of the great lakes of the north.
<br>
<br>3 And the vessels of war of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lake called Ontario , were commanded by a brave man , whose name was Chauncey.
<br>
<br>4 Now on the twenty fifth day of the fourth month , the army of Columbia , who were gathered on the shore of the lake , went down into the strong vessels of Chauncey.
<br>
<br>5 And the number that went into the vessels was about two thousand.
<br>
<br>6 And Henry* and Zebulon , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Pike ,** were the chief captains of the host of Columbia.
<br>
<br>* Major General Dearborn.
<br>
<br>** Brig. Gen. Pike.
<br>
<br>7 On the same day the sails of the vessels were spread to the winds of heaven , and they moved towards a place called Little York ,* in the province of Canada.
<br>
<br>* Capital of U. Canada.
<br>
<br>8 Howbeit , the winds were adverse and blew with great violence from the east.
<br>
<br>9 Nevertheless , on the morning of the twenty-seventh day of the same month , the army of Columbia , commanded by Pike , the chief captain , moved out of the strong ships of the United States.
<br>
<br>10 But Henry remained on board the vessel of Chauncey , neither came he to the water's edge.
<br>
<br>11 And the place where the host of Columbia landed was to the west of the town , about twenty and four furlongs , and from the strong hold of the king about ten furlongs.
<br>
<br>12 The gallant Forsyth , who led a band of brave men , who fought not for filthy lucre's sake , went before the host.
<br>
<br>13 And their weapons of war were of curious workmanship ,* and they sent forth balls of lead ; such as were unknown to Pharaoh when he followed the Children of Israel down into the red sea.
<br>
<br>* Rifles.
<br>
<br>14 Now Zebulon , with a thousand chosen men , followed close after Forsyth , the warrior.
<br>
<br>15 About this time the savages and the servants of the king , even a great multitude , opened their engines of destruction without mercy.
<br>
<br>16 And from the forest , and the secret places , their balls were showered like unto hail-stones , and the sound thereof was as sharp thunder.
<br>
<br>17 And a man , whose name was Sheaffe , was the chief captain of the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>18 Now the destroying engines of the strong hold of the king issued fire and smoke with a mighty noise <span class="delete">,</span> and shot at the vessels of the United States.
<br>
<br>19 But Chauncey returned unto them four-fold ; and the battle waxed hot , both on the land and on the water.
<br>
<br>20 And the men of Columbia rushed forward with fierceness , and drove the men of Britain from their strong hold.
<br>
<br>21 So they fled towards the town for safety , for they were overcome ; and the savages were smitten with fear , their loud yellings ceased , and their feet were light as the wild roe ;
<br>
<br>22 Nevertheless , the men of Columbia shouted aloud , and sounded their trumpets , their cymbals , and their noisy drums , which were contrived since the days of Jeroboam , king of Israel.
<br>
<br>23 And Zebulon , the valiant warrior , followed hard after them ; and they found no rest ; for they were sore pushed , and the phantom of their imaginations pictured out new evils.
<br>
<br>24 So when they found they were nigh being made captive , they departed in haste from the town and from the strong hold thereof , save about two score.
<br>
<br>25 Now when the army of Britain was overthrown ; when they were compelled to flee from the strong hold <span class="delete">;</span> the wickedness of Satan entered into their hearts.
<br>
<br>26 And they gathered together abundance of the black dust and fixed it <span class="delete">into</span> the lowermost part of the fort , below the walls of stone.
<br>
<br>27 After which they put a lighted match nigh to it , so that when the whole army of Columbia got into the hold , they might be destroyed.
<br>
<br>28 But the Lord , who is good , even he who governeth the destinies of man , permitted it not.
<br>
<br>29 Now when Zebulon and his army came out of the thick woods , in battle array , to go forth against the strong hold ,
<br>
<br>30 Lo ! they saw not the host of Britain <span class="delete">:</span> but the eye of Zebulon was as the eye of an eagle , his strength as the lion , and his judgment as the wise :
<br>
<br>31 So he stayed his men of war from rushing forward towards the place , lest they might be entrapped : and he caused them to move along the wood to the right and to the left.
<br>
<br>32 About this time <span class="delete">a stripling ,</span> from the south , with his weapon of war in his hand , ran up to Zebulon , and spake unto him , saying ,
<br>
<br>33 Behold ! a man of Britain <span class="delete">appeareth</span> in the fort ; suffer me , I pray thee , to slay him , for he is busied with the destroying engines :
<br>
<br>34 But Zebulon said , nay ; we are yet a great way off.
<br>
<br>35 And the young man entreated him a second time , saying , i beseech thee , let me step out before the host and slay him , lest the engine be let loose upon us ; then Zebulon said unto him , Go.
<br>
<br>36 So he ran out before the army and shot the man , and he fell to the earth ; and it was about a furlong off , and the weight of the ball was about the weight of a shekel.
<br>
<br>37 But as the young man returned to where the army stayed , behold ! the black dust in the hold caught fire , and it rent the air with the noise of a thousand thunders :
<br>
<br>38 And the whole army fell down upon their faces* to the earth ; and the stones , and the fragments of rocks , were lifted high ; and the falling thereof was terrible <span class="delete">,</span> even unto death.
<br>
<br>* However strange this may appear , it is a fact that the concussion of the air produced that effect on nearly all who fronted the explosion.
<br>
<br>39 Yea , it was dreadful as the mighty earthquake , which overturneth cities.
<br>
<br>40 And the whole face of the earth round about , and the army of Zebulon , were overshadowed with black smoke ; so that , for a time , one man saw not another :
<br>
<br>41 But when the heavy clouds of smoke passed away towards the west , behold the earth was covered with the killed and the wounded.
<br>
<br>42 Alas ! the sight was shocking to behold ; as the deed was ignoble.
<br>
<br>43 About two hundred men rose not : the stones had bruised them ; the sharp rocks had fallen upon them :
<br>
<br>44 They were wedged into the earth : their weapons of war were bent down into the ground with them ; their feet were turned towards heaven ; their limbs were lopped off.
<br>
<br>45 but when those who escaped unhurt arose and looked around , they beheld not their chieftain ; he had fallen to the earth.
<br>
<br>46 A huge stone smote him upon the back , and two of his officers , (one of whom was the gallant Fraser <span class="delete">,*)</span> raised him up and led him forth from the field of murder ; the one on the one side , and the other on the other side.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>* Major Fraser , son of Donald Fraser of New-York.
<br></span>
<br>47 And as they led him away he turned his head around to his brave warriors , and said unto them , Go on <span class="delete">:</span> I will be with you soon ! I am not slain.
<br>
<br>48 The magic of his words gave joy to their hearts ; for they loved him as they loved their own father.
<br>
<br>49 And with resistless force his noble band rushed on , at the trumpet's sound , over the heaps of slain and wounded to glory , and to triumph !
<br>
<br>50 And a swift messenger ran down unto Henry , with these words in his mouth , Lo ! the right hand of our army is slain ! its pride is gone ! Zebulon has fallen <span class="delete">!</span>
<br>
<br>51 Immediately Henry departed from the fleet , and came to the shore , and went up and led the host of Columbia to the town and took it.
<br>
<br>52 Now the slain , the maimed and the captives of the host of Britain that day , were about a thousand fighting men :
<br>
<br>53 And the loss of the men of Columbia was about three hundred slain and wounded.
<br>
<br>54 And Henry , the chief captain , gave great honor to the captains under him , even <span class="delete">Scott , and Boyd , and Porter</span> , and all the brave men that fought that day.
<br>
<br>55 Nevertheless , Sheaffe , the captain of the king , escaped with a handful of men , and the swift-footed savages : leaving behind him the insignia of British mercy !--a human scalp !
<br>
<br>56 But the rejoicings of the people were mingled with deep sorrow ; for the brave were slain in battle.
<br>
<br>57 Oh ! earth , how long shall thy inhabitants delight in warfare ? when shall the old men cease to weep for their children ?
<br>
<br>58 Behold yon lonely widows ; they weep for their husbands and their children ; but they shall see their faces no more !
<br>
<br>59 The fair daughters of Columbia sigh for the return of their beloved.
<br>
<br>60 Seest thou those little ones ? they fly to their disconsolate mother , they leap with joy at the name of father ! but he shall never return !
<br>
<br>61 Oh ! that they had cast the black dust into the sea ! then might not the children of men weep and wail.
<br>
<br>62 Now on the next day , when the army of Zebulon gat the tidings that their captain was slain , the tears started in their eyes ; they were mute , their hearts failed them ; and they became as weak women.
<br>
<br>63 Moreover , the United States made great lamentations over him ; and the remembrance of his name shall live in the hearts of the people.
<br>
<br>64 The eagle of Columbia dropt a feather from her wing , which the angel of brightness caught ere it fell to the earth , ascended to heaven , and recorded the name of Pike.

<br>Behold ! a man of Britain <span class="delstrike">appeareth</span> <span class="insert">appeared</span> in the fort ; suffer me , I pray thee , to slay him , for he is busied with the destroying engines :
<br>
<br>But Zebulon said , nay ; we are yet a great way off.
<br>
<br>And the young man entreated him a second time , saying , i beseech thee , let me step out before the host and slay him , lest the engine be let loose upon us ; then Zebulon said unto him , Go.
<br>
<br>So he ran out before the army and shot the man , and he fell to the earth ; and it was about a furlong off , and the weight of the ball was about the weight of a shekel.
<br>
<br>But as the young man returned to where the army stayed , behold ! the black dust in the hold caught fire , and it rent the air with the noise of a thousand thunders :
<br>
<br>And the whole army fell down upon their faces* to the earth ; and the stones , and the fragments of rocks , were lifted high ; and the falling thereof was terrible <span class="delstrike">,</span> even unto death.
<br>
<br>* However strange this may appear , it is a fact that the concussion of the air produced that effect on nearly all who fronted the explosion.
<br>
<br>Yea , it was dreadful as the mighty earthquake , which overturneth cities.
<br>
<br>And the whole face of the earth round about , and the army of Zebulon , were overshadowed with black smoke ; so that , for a time , one man saw not another :
<br>
<br>But when the heavy clouds of smoke passed away towards the west , behold the earth was covered with the killed and the wounded.
<br>
<br>Alas ! the sight was shocking to behold ; as the deed was ignoble.
<br>
<br>About two hundred men rose not : the stones had <span class="insert">;</span> bruised them ; the sharp rocks had fallen upon them :
<br>
<br>They were wedged into the earth : their weapons of war were bent down into the ground with them ; their feet were turned towards heaven ; their limbs were lopped off.
<br>
<br>but when those who escaped unhurt arose and looked around , they beheld not their chieftain ; he had fallen to the earth.
<br>
<br>A huge stone smote him upon the back , and two of his officers , (one of whom was the gallant Fraser <span class="delstrike">,*)</span> <span class="insert">,)</span> raised him up and led him forth from the field of murder ; the one on the one side , and the other on the other side.
<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>* Major Fraser , son of Donald Fraser of New-York.
<br></span>
<br>And as they led him away he turned his head around to his brave warriors , and said unto them , Go on <span class="delstrike">:</span> <span class="insert">;</span> I will be with you soon ! I am not slain.
<br>
<br>The magic of his words gave joy to their hearts ; for they loved him as they loved their own father.
<br>
<br>And with resistless force his noble band rushed on , at the trumpet's sound , over the heaps of slain and wounded <span class="insert">,</span> to glory , and to triumph !
<br>
<br>And a swift messenger ran down unto Henry , with these words in his mouth , Lo ! the right hand of our army is slain ! its pride is gone ! Zebulon has fallen <span class="delstrike">!</span> <span class="insert">?</span>
<br>
<br>Immediately Henry departed from the fleet , and came to the shore , and went up and led the host of Columbia to the town and took it.
<br>
<br>Now the slain , the maimed and the captives of the host of Britain that day , were about a thousand fighting men :
<br>
<br>And the loss of the men of Columbia was about three hundred slain and wounded.
<br>
<br>And Henry , the chief captain , gave great honor to the captains under him , even <span class="delstrike">Scott , and Boyd , and Porter</span> <span class="insert">Ripley , Forsyth and Eustis</span> , and all the brave men that fought that day.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , Sheaffe , the captain of the king , escaped with a handful of men , and the swift-footed savages : leaving behind him the insignia of British mercy !--a human scalp !
<br>
<br>But the rejoicings of the people were mingled with deep sorrow ; for the brave were slain in battle.
<br>
<br>Oh ! earth , how long shall thy inhabitants delight in warfare ? when shall the old men cease to weep for their children ?
<br>
<br>Behold yon lonely widows ; they weep for their husbands and their children ; but they shall see their faces no more !
<br>
<br>The fair daughters of Columbia sigh for the return of their beloved.
<br>
<br>Seest thou those little ones ? they fly to their disconsolate mother , they leap with joy at the name of father ! but he shall never return !
<br>
<br>Oh ! that they had cast the black dust into the sea ! then might not the children of men weep and wail.
<br>
<br>Now on the next day , when the army of Zebulon gat the tidings that their captain was slain , the tears started in their eyes ; they were mute , their hearts failed them ; and they became as weak women.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the United States made great lamentations over him ; and the remembrance of his name shall live in the hearts of the people.
<br>
<br>The eagle of Columbia dropt a feather from her wing , which the angel of brightness caught ere it fell to the earth , ascended to heaven , and recorded the name of Pike.

<br>
<br>Capture of little York , in Upper Canada--the destruction of the whole American army prevented by the precaution of Gen. Pike--his death.
<br>
<br>NOW , <span class="insert">whilst</span> these things happened in the south , and the evils of war destroyed the life of man , and the smiles of heaven strengthened the arms , and lifted up the glory of <span class="insert">Columbia.</span> ;
<br>
<br>2 Behold , preparations of warfare were making on the borders of the great lakes of the north.
<br>
<br>3 And the vessels of war of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lake called Ontario , were commanded by a brave man , whose name was Chauncey.
<br>
<br>4 Now on the twenty fifth day of the fourth month , the army of Columbia , who were gathered on the shore of the lake , went down into the strong vessels of Chauncey.
<br>
<br>5 And the number that went into the vessels was about two thousand.
<br>
<br>6 And Henry* and Zebulon , whose <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was Pike ,** were the chief captains of the host of Columbia.
<br>
<br>* Major General Dearborn.
<br>
<br>** Brig. Gen. Pike.
<br>
<br>7 On the same day the sails of the vessels were spread to the winds of heaven , and they moved towards a place called Little York ,* in the province of Canada.
<br>
<br>* Capital of U. Canada.
<br>
<br>8 Howbeit , the winds were adverse and blew with great violence from the east.
<br>
<br>9 Nevertheless , on the morning of the twenty-seventh day of the same month , the army of Columbia , commanded by Pike , the chief captain , moved out of the strong ships of the United States.
<br>
<br>10 But Henry remained on board the vessel of Chauncey , neither came he to the water's edge.
<br>
<br>11 And the place where the host of Columbia landed was to the west of the town , about twenty and four furlongs , and from the strong hold of the king about ten furlongs.
<br>
<br>12 The gallant Forsyth , who led a band of brave men , who fought not for filthy lucre's sake , went before the host.
<br>
<br>13 And their weapons of war were of curious workmanship ,* and they sent forth balls of lead ; such as were unknown to Pharaoh when he followed the Children of Israel down into the red sea.
<br>
<br>* Rifles.
<br>
<br>14 Now Zebulon , with a thousand chosen men , followed close after Forsyth , the warrior.
<br>
<br>15 About this time the savages and the servants of the king , even a great multitude , opened their engines of destruction without mercy.
<br>
<br>16 And from the forest , and the secret places , their balls were showered like unto hail-stones , and the sound thereof was as sharp thunder.
<br>
<br>17 And a man , whose name was Sheaffe , was the chief captain of the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>18 Now the destroying engines of the strong hold of the king issued fire and smoke with a mighty noise and shot at the vessels of the United States.
<br>
<br>19 But Chauncey returned unto them four-fold ; and <span class="insert">and</span> the battle waxed hot , both on the land and on the water.
<br>
<br>20 And the men of Columbia rushed forward with fierceness , and drove the men of Britain from their strong hold.
<br>
<br>21 So they fled towards the town for safety , for they were overcome ; and the savages were smitten with fear , their loud yellings ceased , and their feet were light <span class="insert">,</span> as the wild roe ;
<br>
<br>22 Nevertheless , the men of Columbia shouted aloud , and sounded their trumpets , their cymbals , and their noisy drums , which were contrived since the days of Jeroboam , king of Israel.
<br>
<br>23 And Zebulon , the valiant warrior , followed hard after them ; and they found no rest ; for they were sore pushed , and the phantom of their imaginations pictured out new evils.
<br>
<br>24 So when they found they were nigh being made captive , they departed in haste from the town and from the strong hold thereof , save about two score.
<br>
<br>25 Now when the army of Britain was overthrown ; when they were compelled to flee from the strong hold <span class="insert">,</span> the wickedness of Satan entered into their hearts.
<br>
<br>26 And they gathered together abundance of the black dust and fixed it <span class="insert">in</span> the lowermost part of the fort , below the walls of stone.
<br>
<br>27 After which they put a lighted match nigh to it , so that when the whole army of Columbia got into the hold , they might be destroyed.
<br>
<br>28 But the Lord , who is good , even he who governeth the destinies of man , permitted it not.
<br>
<br>29 Now when Zebulon and his army came out of the thick woods , in battle array , to go forth against the strong hold ,
<br>
<br>30 Lo ! they saw not the host of Britain <span class="insert">;</span> but the eye of Zebulon was as the eye of an eagle , his strength as the lion , and his judgment as the wise :
<br>
<br>31 So he stayed his men of war from rushing forward towards the place , lest they might be entrapped : and he caused them to move along the wood to the right <span class="insert">hand</span> and to the left.
<br>
<br>32 About this time <span class="insert">, a stripling</span> from the south , with his weapon of war in his hand , ran up to Zebulon , and spake unto him , saying ,
<br>
<br>33 Behold ! a man of Britain <span class="insert">appeared</span> in the fort ; suffer me , I pray thee , to slay him , for he is busied with the destroying engines :
<br>
<br>34 But Zebulon said , nay ; we are yet a great way off.
<br>
<br>35 And the young man entreated him a second time , saying , i beseech thee , let me step out before the host and slay him , lest the engine be let loose upon us ; then Zebulon said unto him , Go.
<br>
<br>36 So he ran out before the army and shot the man , and he fell to the earth ; and it was about a furlong off , and the weight of the ball was about the weight of a shekel.
<br>
<br>37 But as the young man returned to where the army stayed , behold ! the black dust in the hold caught fire , and it rent the air with the noise of a thousand thunders :
<br>
<br>38 And the whole army fell down upon their faces* to the earth ; and the stones , and the fragments of rocks , were lifted high ; and the falling thereof was terrible even unto death.
<br>
<br>* However strange this may appear , it is a fact that the concussion of the air produced that effect on nearly all who fronted the explosion.
<br>
<br>39 Yea , it was dreadful as the mighty earthquake , which overturneth cities.
<br>
<br>40 And the whole face of the earth round about , and the army of Zebulon , were overshadowed with black smoke ; so that , for a time , one man saw not another :
<br>
<br>41 But when the heavy clouds of smoke passed away towards the west , behold the earth was covered with the killed and the wounded.

<br>
<br>2 The country of Columbia is a wide extended land , which reacheth from the north to the south , more than eight thousand miles ; and the breadth thereof is about three thousand.
<br>
<br>3 Moreover <span class="delete">,</span> the name of the country was called after the name of a great man , who was born in a place called Genoa ; being in Italia , on the sea-coast.
<br>
<br>4 His name was Christopher , <span class="delete">sur-named Columbus.</span>
<br>
<br>5 As the righteous man struggleth against wickedness , so did he against ignorance and stupidity.
<br>
<br>6 Nevertheless , it came to pass , in the fourteen hundred and <span class="delete">ninety-second</span> year of the Christian era , that he crossed the waters of the mighty deep , a thing that had never been known among the sons of <span class="delete">men :</span>
<br>
<br>7 And the place where he landed was an island in the sea , nigh unto the continent of Columbia , called San Salvador ; which , being interpreted , signifieth a place of safety.
<br>
<br>8 And the place was inhabited by wild savages , and they were naked.
<br>
<br>9 Now when the people heard that Columbus had found a new land , they were astonished beyond measure , for it was many thousand miles off ; moreover , some of them strove to rob him of the <span class="delete">honor</span> , and he was treated wrongfully.
<br>
<br>10 But his name was lifted up above his enemies , and it shall not be lost.
<br>
<br>11 Now the land of Columbia is a most plentiful land , yielding gold and silver , and brass and iron abundantly.
<br>
<br>12 Likewise , all manner of creatures , and herbs and fruits of the earth <span class="delete">,</span>
<br>
<br>13 From the red cherry , and the rosy peach of the north , to the lemon , and the golden orange of the south.
<br>
<br>14 from the small insect , that cheateth the microscopic eye , to the huge mammoth that once moved on the borders of the river Hudson ; on the great river Ohio ; and even down to the country of Patagonia in the south.
<br>
<br>15 Now the <span class="delete">height</span> of a mammoth is about seven cubits and <span class="delete">an</span> half , and the length thereof fourteen cubits ; and the bones thereof being weighed <span class="delete">were</span> more than thirty thousand shekels ; and the length of the tusks is more than six cubits.

<br>* Jefferson's notes on Virginia.
<br>
<br>17 The fierce <span class="delete">tiger</span> and the spotted leopard dwell in the dark forests ; and the swift-footed deer upon the mountains and high places.
<br>
<br>18 Now the number of inhabitants that are spread over the whole continent , is more than an hundred million.
<br>
<br>19 And the people of Columbia , who are independent of the tyrants of the earth , and who dwell between the great river which is called Mississippi , in the south , and the province of Canada <span class="delete">,</span> in the north , being numbered , are about <span class="delete">a</span> thousand times ten thousand souls.*
<br>
<br>* The last census , in 1810 , stated the amount at about 8 ,000 ,000 , the number may now probably be increased to 10 ,000 ,000.
<br>
<br>20 The men are comely and noble , and cowardice hath forgot to light upon them : neither are they a superstitious people <span class="delete">;</span> they are peace-makers , they love the God of Israel , and worship him ; and there are no idolaters amongst them.
<br>
<br>21 The women are passing beautiful ; they are like unto fresh lilies ; their cheeks are like wild roses ; their lips as a thread of scarlet ; nature hath gifted them with Roman virtue and patriotism ; and they have spread goodness with a plentiful hand.
<br>
<br>22 Now it had happened in times past that the king of Britain had made war upon the people of Columbia , even forty years ago.
<br>
<br>23 For the riches and prosperity of Columbia had become great , and the king coveted them.
<br>
<br>24 And the war raged with the might of Britain , even in the heart of the land of Columbia , for about the space of seven years , when the army of Columbia became triumphant ; neither could the power of Britain conquer the sons of liberty.
<br>
<br>25 <span class="delete">So</span> those who remained of the armies of Britain returned home to the king , their master ; <span class="delete">and</span> there was peace throughout the United States , and a covenant made between the nations.

<br>THE voice of many years shall drop upon the children of men ; and our children's children shall hearken unto it in the days to come.
<br>
<br>2 The country of Columbia is a wide extended land , which reacheth from the north to the south , more than eight thousand miles ; and the breadth thereof is about three thousand.
<br>
<br>3 Moreover the name of the country was called after the name of a great man , who was born in a place called Genoa ; being in Italia , on the sea-coast.
<br>
<br>4 His name was Christopher , <span class="insert">sir-named Columbus</span>
<br>
<br>5 As the righteous man struggleth against wickedness , so did he against ignorance and stupidity.
<br>
<br>6 Nevertheless , it came to pass , in the fourteen hundred and <span class="insert">ninety second</span> year of the Christian era , that he crossed the waters of the mighty deep , a thing that had never been known among the sons of <span class="insert">men.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And the place where he landed was an island in the sea , nigh unto the continent of Columbia , called San Salvador ; which , being interpreted , signifieth a place of safety.
<br>
<br>8 And the place was inhabited by wild savages , and they were naked.
<br>
<br>9 Now when the people heard that Columbus had found a new land , they were astonished beyond measure , for it was many thousand miles off ; moreover , some of them strove to rob him of the <span class="insert">honour</span> , and he was treated wrongfully.
<br>
<br>10 But his name was lifted up above his enemies , and it shall not be lost.
<br>
<br>11 Now the land of Columbia is a most plentiful land , yielding gold and silver , and brass and iron abundantly.
<br>
<br>12 Likewise , all manner of creatures <span class="insert">which are used for food</span> , and herbs and fruits of the earth <span class="insert">:</span>
<br>
<br>13 From the red cherry , and the rosy peach of the north , to the lemon , and the golden orange of the south.
<br>
<br>14 <span class="insert">And</span> from the small insect , that cheateth the microscopic eye , to the huge mammoth that once moved on the borders of the river Hudson ; on the great river Ohio ; and even down to the country of Patagonia in the south.
<br>
<br>15 Now the <span class="insert">heighth</span> of a mammoth is about seven cubits and <span class="insert">a</span> half , and the length thereof fourteen cubits ; and the bones thereof being weighed <span class="insert">are</span> more than thirty thousand shekels ; and the length of the tusks is more than six cubits.
<br>
<br>16 It is more wonderful than the elephant ; and the history thereof , is it not recorded in the book of Jefferson , the scribe ?*
<br>
<br>* Jefferson's notes on Virginia.
<br>
<br>17 The fierce <span class="insert">tyger</span> and the spotted leopard dwell in the dark forests ; and the swift-footed deer upon the mountains and high places.
<br>
<br>18 Now the number of inhabitants that are spread over the whole continent , is more than an hundred million.
<br>
<br>19 And the people of Columbia , who are independent of the tyrants of the earth , and who dwell between the great river which is called Mississippi , in the south , and the province of Canada in the north , being numbered , are about <span class="insert">ten</span> thousand times ten thousand souls.*
<br>
<br>* The last census , in 1810 , stated the amount at about 8 ,000 ,000 , the number may now probably be increased to 10 ,000 ,000.
<br>
<br>20 The men are comely and noble , and cowardice hath forgot to light upon them : neither are they a superstitious people <span class="insert">;.</span> they are peace-makers , they love the God of Israel , and worship him ; and there are no idolaters amongst them.
<br>
<br>21 The women are passing beautiful ; they are like unto fresh lilies ; their cheeks are like wild roses ; their lips as a thread of scarlet ; nature hath gifted them with Roman virtue and patriotism ; and they have spread goodness with a plentiful hand.
<br>
<br>22 Now it had happened in times past that the king of Britain had made war upon the people of Columbia , even forty years ago.
<br>
<br>23 For the riches and prosperity of Columbia had become great , and the king coveted them.
<br>
<br>24 And the war raged with the might of Britain , even in the heart of the land of Columbia , for about the space of seven years , when the army of Columbia became triumphant ; neither could the power of Britain conquer the sons of liberty.
<br>
<br>25 <span class="insert">Accordingly a part of</span> those who remained of the armies of Britain returned home to the king , their master ; <span class="insert">but a great number refused to return , preferring a country whose mild laws are equally and righteously dispensed , and where the hard earnings of industry are not taken away by the tax-gatherer :
<br>
<br>26 So</span> there was peace throughout the United States , and a covenant made between the nations.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>27</span> But the names of the wise men of the great Sanhedrim in those days , and the names of those who fought hard in battle , and spilt their blood in the cause of liberty , are they not written in the books of the chronicles of those days ?
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>28</span> Now the fatness of the land of Columbia bringeth people from all nations to dwell therein.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>29</span> The people of Columbia use no persuasion , the sacred cause of Liberty is the star of attraction ; and the time shall come when the eyes of all men shall be opened , and the earth shall rejoice.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>30</span> Their laws are wholesome , for the people are the lawgivers , even as it was in the days of Cesar <span class="insert">;</span> but they know no kings.

<br>
<br>Depredations in the Chesapeake--Havre-de-Grace burnt by the British under Adm. Cockburn--attack on Crany Island--Hampton taken by the British--outrages.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , that the mighty fleet of Britain , which was moving round about the great Bay of Chesapeake , committed much evil upon the shores thereof.
<br>
<br>2 And they robbed those who were defenceless , and carried away their fatted cattle , their sheep , and all those things which they found , and put them into the strong ships of the king.
<br>
<br>3 Moreover , they <span class="delete">burned</span> the dwellings of the helpless with fire , and they accounted it sport.
<br>
<br>4 And the old men , the little children , and the women , yea the fair daughters of Columbia , were compelled to fly from the wickedness of barbarians.
<br>
<br>5 Even the small villages that rose beautifully on the river side , became a prey unto them , and were consumed by the mighty conquerors of Europe.
<br>
<br>6 They were like hungry wolves that are never satisfied ; destruction and devastation marked their <span class="delete">footsteps.</span>
<br>
<br>7 Now the ships of the king were commanded by a wicked man whose name was Cockburn.
<br>
<br>8 And it was so that on the third day of the fifth month , in the thirty and seventh year of the independence of the people of Columbia ,
<br>
<br>9 Cockburn , <span class="delete">sur-named</span> the wicked , led forth a host of the savage men of Britain , against a pleasant village , called Havre-de-Grace , which lieth on the borders of the Susquehanna , a noble river ; being in the state of Maryland.
<br>
<br>10 Now there was none to defend the place , save one man , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was O'Neil , who came from the land of Hibernia , and him they made captive.
<br>
<br>11 And they came as the barbarians of the wilderness <span class="delete">;</span> fierceness was in their looks , cruelty was in their hearts.
<br>
<br>12 To the dwelling houses they put the burning brand , and plundered the poor and needy without pity <span class="delete">;</span> such wickedness was not done even among the Philistines.
<br>
<br>13 The women and children cried aloud , and fell down at the feet of the chief captain of the king : but , alas ! his heart was like unto the heart of Pharaoh ; he heard them not.
<br>
<br>14 However , it came to pass , the next day , when the <span class="delete">brave</span> Cockburn had collected his booty , and glutted his savage disposition , he departed.
<br>
<br>15 And on the sixth day of the same month he went against other unprotected villages , which lie on the river Sassafras , called <span class="delete">,</span> Frederickstown and Georgetown , and burnt them also.
<br>
<br>16 So did he return to his wickedness as a dog returneth to his vomit.
<br>
<br>17 Now about this time the number of the strong ships of Britain <span class="delete">were</span> increased , and great multitudes of the soldiers of the king came with them to the waters of the Chesapeake.
<br>
<br>18 And it came to pass , on the twenty-second day of the next month , that Cockburn , the chief captain of the ships of Britain , essayed to go against a small island , nigh unto Norfolk <span class="delete">,</span> in the state of Virginia , called in the vernacular tongue <span class="delete">Crany-Island.</span>
<br>
<br>19 And the number of the men of Britain that went against the island was about five thousand ; and they began to get upon the shore <span class="delete">about</span> the dawning of the day.
<br>
<br>20 Near unto this place a few vessels of Columbia , commanded by the gallant Cassin , were hemmed in by about a score of the mighty ships of the king.
<br>
<br>21 Now the fighting vessels under Cassin were mostly small , and were called gun-boats , and they were little more than half a score in number.
<br>
<br>22 Howbeit , but a few days before they went against the Junon ,* a strong ship of Britain , and compelled her to depart from before the mouths of the destroying engines.
<br>
<br>* British frigate Junon.
<br>
<br>23 But <span class="delete">the</span> island was defenceless ; and there came to protect it an hundred brave seamen from the gun-boats , and an hundred and fifty valiant men from the Constellation a fighting ship of the United States.
<br>
<br>24 And they brought the destroying engines with them , and they let them loose upon the vessels of the king , and upon the men who were landing upon the shore.
<br>
<br>25 And the thundering noise thereof astonished the servants of the <span class="delete">king ;</span> for they knew there was but a handful of men upon the island.
<br>
<br>26 Moreover , Britain in her folly had <span class="delete">invented</span> a new instrument of destruction , <span class="delete">which they</span> called Congreve Rockets <span class="delete">; and they threw them</span> in great abundance.
<br>
<br>27 But they were harmless as turtle doves , for they killed not a man.
<br>
<br>28 Now the men of Columbia , with their handicraft , shot the balls of iron strait as an arrow from a bow , and thereby did much damage to the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of the king.
<br>
<br>29 Inasmuch as they slew about two hundred of the men of Britain that day ; and drove the host of them from the island.
<br>
<br>30 So the mighty army of Britain fled in haste to the strong ships of the king for safety.
<br>
<br>31 Now on the twenty-fifth day of the same month the army of Britain went against a village called Hampton , which lieth in the state of Virginia , and took it.
<br>
<br>32 Howbeit , the little band of Columbia , commanded by Crutchfield , fought hard against them.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , they prevailed over him , and slew seven of his men , and wounded others , upon which he fled ; for the men of Britain were like unto a swarm of locusts.
<br>
<br>34 But the blood of two hundred royal <span class="delete">slaves</span> became a sacrifice to the wickedness of their leaders.
<br>
<br>35 <span class="delete">There is a time when truth may be uttered with pleasure ; and the droppings thereof are like unto frankincense and myrrh.
<br>
<br>36 But , alas ! the hour hath passed away or it hath not yet come ; she hath gone down into the vale of tears ; yea , deep sorrow treadeth upon her heels.
<br>
<br>37 Oh ! Albion</span> ! that a veil might be cast over <span class="delete">the</span> transgressions of that day :
<span class="delete"><br>
<br>38</span> Thy wickedness shall be written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>39</span> It was here , even in Hampton , that thy strength and thy majesty rose up against the poor <span class="delete">the sick</span> and the needy.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>40</span> Instead of protecting the tender women , the fairest work of God <span class="delete">;</span> the life of the world ; behold ! what hast thou done ?
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>41</span> See ! the shrieking matron cast herself into the waters that she may escape thy brutal violence : but all in vain ; her garments are torn from her ; she becomes a prey to thy savage lust.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>42</span> Not she alone , but her daughter , and her fair sisters , have fallen into thy unhallowed hands , and been defiled !
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>43</span> Oh , Britain ! the voice of violated chastity riseth up against thee <span class="delete">:</span> the mark of the beast is printed in thy forehead :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>44</span> Even the old and weak men became victims of thy barbarity ; thy servants stripped the aged Hope , and buffeted him ; with the <span class="delete">points</span> of their swords did they torment him.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>45</span> Do the groans of the murdered Kirby creep into thine ears ? go thou and repent of thine evil <span class="delete">;</span> and do so no more : the Lord God of Hosts shall be thy <span class="delete">judge.
<br>
<br>46 The</span> people of Columbia <span class="delete">shall</span> forgive thy crimes against them ; but the remembrance thereof shall live <span class="delete">coeval with</span> time ; neither shall they forget the name of Cockburn.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>47 Even the sect of the tories despised him ; the evils which he wrought caused many of them to turn aside and walk in the footsteps of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<br>48 And thou , black Revenge ! dreadful fiend ! sleep within the precincts of Hampton : a strong seal is put upon thy sepulchre ; the sons of Columbia shall not disturb thee.
<br>
<br>49 When they pass by this ill-fated town , they shall step aside and weep ; neither shall they enter the streets thereof , lest they awaken thee.
<br>
<br>50 And woe unto the royal potentate , or the princely ruler , that shall presume to break the seal , or rouse thee from thy slumbers !
<br>
<br>51 Thy waking will be as the waking of the hungry tiger , when he riseth up to refresh himself ; retribution shall be obtained ; and the heathen shall tremble.

<br>
<br>* British frigate <span class="insert">,</span> Junon.
<br>
<br>23 But <span class="insert">this</span> island was defenceless ; and there came to protect it an hundred brave seamen from the gun-boats , and an hundred and fifty valiant men from the Constellation <span class="insert">,</span> a fighting ship of the United States.
<br>
<br>24 And they brought the destroying engines with them , and they let them loose upon the vessels of the king , and upon the men who were landing upon the shore.
<br>
<br>25 And the thundering noise thereof astonished the servants of the <span class="insert">king:</span> for they knew there was but a handful of men upon the island.
<br>
<br>26 Moreover , Britain in her folly had <span class="insert">introduced</span> a new instrument of destruction , called Congreve Rockets <span class="insert">, in honour of their inventor ; and these were used</span> in great abundance.
<br>
<br>27 But they were harmless as turtle doves , for they killed not a man.
<br>
<br>28 Now the men of Columbia , with their handicraft , shot the balls of iron strait as an arrow from a bow , and <span class="insert">;</span> thereby did much damage to the <span class="insert">servants</span> of the king.
<br>
<br>29 Inasmuch as they slew about two hundred of the men of Britain that day ; and drove the host of them from the island.
<br>
<br>30 So the mighty army of Britain fled in haste to the strong ships of the king for safety.
<br>
<br>31 Now on the twenty-fifth day of the same month the army of Britain went against a village called Hampton , which lieth in the state of Virginia , and took it.
<br>
<br>32 Howbeit , the little band of Columbia , commanded by Crutchfield , fought hard against them.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , they prevailed over him , and slew seven of his men , and wounded others , upon which he fled ; for the men of Britain were like unto a swarm of locusts.
<br>
<br>34 But the blood of two hundred royal <span class="insert">invaders</span> became a sacrifice to the wickedness of their leaders.
<br>
<br>35 <span class="insert">Oh ! England</span> ! that a veil might be cast over <span class="insert">thy</span> transgressions of that day : <span class="insert">but it cannot be.
<br>
<br>36</span> Thy wickedness shall be written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>37</span> It was here , even in Hampton , that thy strength and thy majesty rose up against the poor <span class="insert">, the sick ,</span> and the needy.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>38</span> Instead of protecting the tender women , the fairest work of God <span class="insert">,</span> the life of the world ; behold ! what hast thou done ?
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>39</span> See ! the shrieking matron cast herself into the waters that she may escape thy brutal violence : but all in vain ; her garments are torn from her ; she becomes a prey to thy savage lust.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>40</span> Not she alone , but her daughter , and her fair sisters , have fallen into thy unhallowed hands , and been defiled !
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>41</span> Oh , Britain ! the voice of violated chastity riseth up against thee <span class="insert">;</span> the mark of the beast is <span class="insert">indelibly</span> printed in thy forehead :
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>42</span> Even the old and weak men became victims of thy barbarity ; thy servants stripped the aged Hope , and buffeted him ; with the <span class="insert">point</span> of their swords did they torment him.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>43</span> Do the groans of the murdered Kirby creep into thine ears ? go thou and repent of thine evil <span class="insert">,</span> and do so no more : the Lord God of Hosts shall be thy <span class="insert">judge ;
<br>
<br>44 The generous</span> people of Columbia <span class="insert">may possibly</span> forgive thy crimes against them ; but the remembrance thereof shall live <span class="insert">to the end of</span> time ; neither shall they forget the name of Cockburn.

<br>Russian mediation--Bayard and Gallatin sail for St. Petersburgh--the British compelled to abandon the siege of Fort Meigs.
<br>
<br>THE lofty eagle cutteth the air with his wings , and moveth rapidly along ; the fish of the deep glide swiftly through the waters ; the timid deer bounds through the thick forests with wonderful speed :
<br>

<br>
<br>3 In an instant she flieth from the frozen mountains of Zembla , in the regions of the north , to the burning sands of Africa <span class="delete">,</span> in the torrid zone.
<br>
<br>4 Now the sons of Columbia were peace-makers ; neither did their footsteps follow after warfare.
<br>
<br>5 <span class="delete">(It</span> is written in the holy scriptures , Blessed are the peace-makers , for they shall be called the children of <span class="delete">God.)</span>
<br>
<br>6 So the great Sanhedrim of the people sent two of the wise men of Columbia , the one named Gallatin and the other Bayard , into a distant country :
<br>
<br>7 Even unto the extensive country of Russia , that there they might meet the wise men of Britain , and heal the wounds of the nations , and make peace with one another.
<br>
<br>8 But the people of Britain <span class="delete">are a stiffnecked race , and they</span> yielded not to the entreaties of the great Sanhedrim ; therefore the war continued to rage.
<br>
<br>9 So it came to pass , on the fifth day of the fifth month , in the pleasant season of the year ; when the trees put forth their leaves and the air is perfumed with the sweet scent of flowers , and the blue violets bespread the green hillocks ;
<br>
<br>10 That Harrison , the chief captain , from the west <span class="delete">,</span> the brave warrior , who had entrenched himself In the strong hold of Meigs , nigh unto the river Miami , sallied forth against the savages and the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain , that hemmed him in.
<br>
<br>11 Now there were about a thousand soldiers of the king , and a thousand savages that had besieged the fort many days ; and threw therein the balls of destruction , and strove to make captive the army of Columbia.
<br>
<br>12 Nevertheless Harrison , and his gallant little band , fought hard against them , and drove them from before the strong hold with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>13 Likewise , the slain of Columbia was about four score , besides the wounded.
<br>
<br>14 Moreover , the chief captain gave great <span class="delete">honor</span> to Miller and all the captains and soldiers under him ; even those called militia.
<br>
<br>15 And the names of the states <span class="delete">called</span> Ohio and Kentucky were raised high , by the valiant acts of their sons that day.

<br>5 In the meantime the army landed upon the shore , and went against the servants of the king.

<br>
<br>8 Moreover , the slain and wounded of the king were two hundred two score and ten ; of the men of Columbia about three score were slain and maimed.

<br>Capture of the <span class="delete">Chesapeake--Com.</span> Decatur blockaded in New-London.
<br>
<br>IN these days the pride of Britain was sorely wounded <span class="delete">;</span> for she had been discomfited upon the waters of the great deep ; and disappointment had sharpened her anger.
<br>
<br>2 The people of Columbia had triumphed over her ships ; and her mighty armies had gained no honors.
<br>
<br>3 Notwithstanding she had made peace with the nations of Europe , and her whole strength was turned against the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>4 The prosperity of many hundred years had flattered her , and she was puffed up with the vanity thereof ; yea , she had forgotten herself.
<br>
<br>5 So it came to pass , on the first day of the sixth month , a certain strong ship of the king , called the Shannon , appeared before the haven of Boston , which lieth to the east.
<br>
<br>6 And she <span class="delete">bid</span> defiance to the vessels of Columbia ; for she had prepared herself for the event.
<br>
<br>7 Now the Chesapeake , a fighting ship of the United States , was nigh unto the place ; and she was commanded by the brave Lawrence , who had gained much honor in the sight of the people ; neither was he <span class="delete">afraid.</span>
<br>
<br>8 And he went forth to battle against the vessel of the king , which was commanded by Broke , a valiant man.
<br>
<br>9 Moreover , the mischievous engines that were in the ship of Britain were more , <span class="delete">likewise</span> the number of their men <span class="delete">were</span> greater than those of the vessel of the United States.
<br>
<br>10 For Broke had gotten about two hundred men , and secreted them <span class="delete">,</span> so that when the hour of danger arrived they might assist his men , and fall unawares upon the men of Lawrence.
<br>
<br>11 Nevertheless , towards the going down of the sun , the vessels drew nigh <span class="delete">unto</span> each other.
<br>
<br>12 And Lawrence spake unto his officers and his mariners , saying :
<br>
<br>13 Now shall we set our engines at the work of destruction ; let the fire issue out of their mouths , as it were like unto fiery dragons.
<br>
<br>14 And although their numbers be greater than ours , yet <span class="delete">may we</span> be conquerors ; for he who is little of spirit gaineth nothing.
<br>
<br>15 But if , peradventure , we should be overcome , even then shall not the sacred cause of Liberty perish , neither shall the people of Columbia be disheartened.
<br>
<br>16 Also , your names shall be recorded as the champions of freedom.
<br>
<br>17 And the nations of the earth shall learn with astonishment , how dearly you prize the inheritance of your fathers.
<br>
<br>18 Now when Lawrence had made an end of speaking , they sat the destroying engines to work , and rushed one upon another like fierce <span class="delete">tigers.</span>
<br>
<br>19 The fire and smoke were abundant , and tremendous was the noise that floated upon the waters <span class="delete">round about ,</span>
<br>
<br>20 And the Chesapeake fell close upon the Shannon , swords clashed with swords , and pikes with pikes ; and dreadful was the conflict thereof.
<br>
<br>21 But the men of Broke were more numerous than the men of Lawrence , and overpowered them , by the means of their numbers.
<br>
<br>22 Already had the valiant Lawrence fallen ; his life-blood flowed fast ; still he <span class="delete">cried</span> out to his brave companions , saying unto them , Don't give up the ship <span class="delete">:</span> his noble spirit fled , but his name shall not perish.
<br>
<br>23 Moreover , about this time all the officers of the ship of the United States were either slain or sorely wounded ; so she was captured by the vessel of the king.
<br>
<br>24 <span class="delete">After which the wickedness of barbarians again came forth ; to be conquerors was not enough : but they were vain-glorious and overjoyed , and so became prodigal in spilling the blood of their prisoners.
<br>
<br>25</span> Satan rose up in <span class="delete">their hearts</span> , and they shot the balls of death down into the hold of the vessel of the United States , even against the halt and maimed who had surrendered themselves.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>26</span> And when the tidings thereof reached the kingdom of Great Britain , the lords , the princes , the rulers , yea , all the people were rejoiced beyond measure.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>27 And they bid</span> their roaring engines utter their voices <span class="delete">,</span> in London , their chief city , that had been silent many years , even those in the great tower ,* which was built by William the <span class="delete">conqueror</span> , more than seven hundred years ago.
<br>
<br>* On this occasion they fired their tower guns , which had not been done since Nelson's victory.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>28</span> Their joy was unbounded , for they had overcome one of the strong ships of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> Now the slain and the wounded on board the Chesapeake , were an hundred two score and four ; and there fell of the servants of the king about two hundred.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>30</span> Amongst the slain of Columbia were also Augustus , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Ludlow , and another brave officer whose name was White.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>31</span> And when the people of Columbia heard of a truth that Lawrence was slain , they mourned for him many days.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> His body was conveyed to a place called Halifax , in the province of the king , where they <span class="delete">honored his name</span> , and buried him for a while.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33 But in process of time</span> his body was taken out of the earth , <span class="delete">likewise</span> the body of Ludlow , and conveyed to the city of <span class="delete">New-York.
<br>
<br>34</span> And the captain's name who brought the bodies away from Halifax , was <span class="delete">Crowninshield.
<br>
<br>35</span> So Lawrence was buried in the burial-place of his fathers , in his own land : and a great multitude of people went out to behold the funeral as it passed through the city.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> And his valiant deeds shall live in the remembrance of the people.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>37</span> About this time , on the fourth day of the month , the brave Decatur essayed to go forth with his <span class="delete">vessels</span> upon the waters of the mighty deep.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>38</span> And the vessels that were with him were called the United States , the Hornet , and the Macedonian ; a strong ship which he had captured from the king.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>39</span> But it was so , that some large vessels of Britain , carrying each of them more than seventy of the destroying engines , suffered him not to go forth.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>40</span> Moreover , they wished to retake the Macedonian , that they might retrieve the shame of the capture thereof.
<br>
<br>40 So the ships of Britain blockaded Decatur and his ships in the haven of New-London , <span class="delete">being in the latitude of blue-lights ,</span> which lieth in the state of Connecticut , nigh unto a place called Stonington <span class="delete">,</span> and they remained there many months.

<br>Capture of the <span class="delstrike">Chesapeake--Com.</span> <span class="insert">Chesapeake--Commodore</span> Decatur blockaded in New-London.
<br>
<br>IN these days the pride of Britain was sorely wounded <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">:</span> for she had been discomfited upon the waters of the great deep ; and disappointment had sharpened her anger.
<br>
<br>The people of Columbia had triumphed over her ships ; and her mighty armies had gained no honors.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding she had made peace with the nations of Europe , and her whole strength was turned against the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>The prosperity of many hundred years had flattered her , and she was puffed up with the vanity thereof ; yea , she had forgotten herself.
<br>
<br>So it came to pass , on the first day of the sixth month , <span class="insert">that</span> a certain strong ship of the king , called the Shannon , appeared before the haven of Boston , which lieth to the east.
<br>
<br>And she <span class="delstrike">bid</span> <span class="insert">bade</span> defiance to the vessels of Columbia ; for she had prepared herself for the event.
<br>
<br>Now the Chesapeake , a fighting ship of the United States , was nigh unto the place ; and she was commanded by the brave Lawrence , who had gained much honor in the sight of the people ; neither was he <span class="delstrike">afraid.</span> <span class="insert">afraid</span>
<br>
<br>And he went forth to battle against the vessel of the king , which was commanded by Broke , a valiant man.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the mischievous engines that were in the ship of Britain were more , <span class="delstrike">likewise</span> <span class="insert">and</span> the number of their men <span class="delstrike">were</span> greater than those of the vessel of the United States.
<br>
<br>For Broke had gotten about two hundred men , and secreted them <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> so that when the hour of danger arrived they might assist his men , and fall unawares upon the men of Lawrence.

<br>
<br>Also , your names shall be recorded as the champions of freedom.
<br>
<br>And the nations of the earth shall learn with astonishment , how dearly you prize the inheritance of your fathers.
<br>
<br>Now when Lawrence had made an end of speaking , they sat the destroying engines to work , and rushed one upon another like fierce <span class="delstrike">tigers.</span> <span class="insert">tygers.</span>
<br>
<br>The fire and smoke were abundant , and tremendous was the noise that <span class="insert">rent the air and</span> floated upon the waters <span class="delstrike">round about ,</span> <span class="insert">.</span>
<br>
<br>And the Chesapeake fell close upon the Shannon , swords clashed with swords , and pikes with pikes ; and dreadful was the conflict thereof.
<br>
<br>But the men of Broke were more numerous than the men of Lawrence , and overpowered them , by the means of their numbers.
<br>
<br>Already had the valiant Lawrence fallen ; his life-blood flowed fast ; still he <span class="delstrike">cried</span> <span class="insert">cryed</span> out to his brave companions , saying unto them , Don't give up the ship <span class="delstrike">:</span> <span class="insert">;</span> his noble spirit fled , but his name shall not perish.

 <span class="insert"><br>7</span> And the name of the place where he essayed to go was called Beaver-dams , being distant from the strong hold of Queenstown about seventy furlongs.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>8</span> And the number of the men of war of Columbia who followed after him was little more than five hundred.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>9</span> But when they came nigh unto the place , early in the morning of the next day , lo ! they were encompassed round about by the savages and soldiers of the king.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>10</span> Nevertheless , they fought bravely for a time <span class="insert">;</span> and Dearborn , the chief captain of Fort George , sent the valiant Chrystie to help him out of his snare.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>11</span> But Boerstler and his army had already become captive to the men of Britain.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>12</span> And they made a covenant in writing , between one another , but the men of Britain violated the covenant.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>13</span> Inasmuch as they permitted the savages to rob the officers of their swords , and their apparel , yea , even the shoes from off their feet.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>14</span> After which the men of Columbia were commanded to go <span class="insert">,</span> in boats , down to the strong hold of Kingston , in the province of the king.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>15</span> But a certain brave captain , called Chapin ,* a cunning man withal , made his escape in a boat , and arrived at the strong hold of Fort George ; having , by the strength of his single arm , overpowered three of the strong men of Britain.
<br>
<br>* Major Chapin.

<br>
<br>AND it came to pass , on the fourth day of the seventh month , which is the birth day of Columbian Liberty and Independence ,
<br>
<br>2 In the dark and solemn hour of the night , when the deadly savage walketh abroad , and the hungry wolves howl along the forest ,
<br>
<br>3 A band of the men of Britain crossed over the water from Chippawa to a place called Fort Schlosser ,
<br>
<br>4 And there was a handful of the men of the United States in the place , whom they made captive , being twelve in number.
<br>
<br>5 Likewise , they carried away the bread and the meat , and some of the strong waters ; also one of the destroying engines.
<br>
<br>6 Moreover , the engine which they brought away was made partly of brass , partly of iron , and partly of wood.
<br>
<br>7 And the weight of the ball that issued out of its mouth was about two hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary.
<br>
<br>8 On the tenth day of the same month they also passed over the river Niagara , towards a place called Black Rock , and the small band at the place fled.
<br>
<br>9 And they destroyed the strong house , and the camp with fire , and carried away the flour , and the salt <span class="delete">,</span> and such things as they stood in need of.
<br>
<br>10 However , while they were yet carrying them away , there came a band of men of the United States , from the village of Buffaloe ,
<br>
<br>11 And let their instruments of war loose upon them ; and smote them even unto death ; albeit , those who were not slain escaped with their plunder.
<br>
<br>12 And they fled hastily away , leaving nine of their slain behind , and more than half a score of captives.
<br>
<br>13 The soldiers of the king were commanded by two men , the one called Bishop and the other Warren , and the men of Columbia were commanded by a chief captain , named Porter.*

<br>14 About this time the savages and the men of war of Britain assailed the guards and the out-posts near unto Fort <span class="delete">George.</span>
<br>
<br>15 Day after day and night after night did they annoy them ; and many were slain on both sides.
<br>
<br>16 And Dearborn , the chief captain of the fort , and of the host of Columbia round about Niagara , became sick and unable to go out to battle.
<br>
<br>17 So Boyd , a brave and tried warrior , was made chief captain in his stead , until Wilkinson , the chief captain , arrived : and the gallant Fraser was appointed one of his aids.
<br>
<br>18 Now there were some amongst the tribes of the savages , who had been instructed in the ways of God , and taught to walk in the path of righteousness ;
<br>
<br>19 For the chief governor of the land of Columbia , and the great Sanhedrim of the people , had taken them under their <span class="delete">care ,</span>

<br>Affairs on lake Ontario , between the fleets of Com. Chauncey and Sir James Yeo.
<br>
<br>IN those days , the great waters of the lake Ontario were troubled with the movements of the fighting ships of Columbia , as well as those of the king.
<br>
<br>2 Now the fleet of the king , which was commanded by Yeo , who was a skilful captain , was greater than the fleet of Columbia , which was commanded by the brave Chauncey.
<br>
<br>3 And they had contrived to move to and fro upon the bosom of the lake Ontario many months ,
<br>
<br>4 And two of the small vessels , called the Julia and the Growler , being parted from the fleet , fell into the hands of Yeo.
<br>
<br>5 Nevertheless , Chauncey followed after Yeo , and hemmed him in for a time.
<br>
<br>6 But a strong west wind arose and the fleets were again separated.
<br>
<br>7 After this Chauncey captured a number of small fighting vessels , and about three hundred soldiers of the king.
<br>
<br>8 Now it was so , that when Yeo put his fleet in battle array , as though he would fight ,
<br>
<br>9 Then Chauncey went out against him , to meet him , and give him battle ; but the heart of Yeo failed him <span class="delete">,</span> and he turned aside from the ships of Columbia.
<br>
<br>10 So Chauncey sailed along the borders of the lake , from the one end to the other ; even from Niagara to Sackett's <span class="delete">Harbor</span> , and Yeo followed him not.
<br>
<br>11 Now all the vessels of the king , and all the vessels of the United States , that carried the destroying engines , upon the lake Ontario , being numbered were about seventeen.
<br>
<br>12 Howsoever , they cut down the tall trees of the forest , and hewed them , and built many more strong vessels ; although they had no <span class="delete">gopher-wood</span> amongst them in these days.
<br>
<br>13 And they made stories to them , even to the third story , and they put windows in them , and they pitched them within and without with pitch ; after the fashion of the ark.

<br>Affairs on Lake Champlain--pillage of Plattsburgh by the British--bombardment of Burlington--depredations committed in the Chesapeake , and along the coast.
<br>
<br>NOW the fighting vessels of Britain began to appear upon the lake , called <span class="delete">,</span> by the ancient Gauls , Champlain.
<br>
<br>2 And the vessels of war of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lake were not yet prepared for battle ; the name of <span class="delete">the commander whereof</span> was McDonough , <span class="delete">(a stripling).</span>
<br>
<br>3 So it came to pass , on the thirty and first day of the seventh month , that the vessels of the king came forward against Plattsburgh , which lieth on the borders of the lake.
<br>
<br>4 And there were none to defend the place ; for the army of Hampton , a chief captain of the United States , was encamped upon the opposite side of the lake , at a place called Burlington , in the state of Vermont.
<br>
<br>5 And the number of the soldiers of the king that landed at Plattsburgh was more than a thousand men , and the name of their chief captain was Murray.
<br>
<br>6 And a captain of the United States , whose name was Mooers , a man of valor , strove to gather together the husbandmen of the place <span class="delete">,</span> but they were not enough.
<br>
<br>7 So the army of the king captured the place ; and the men of Columbia fled before the men of <span class="delete">war of</span> Britain.
<br>
<br>8 Moreover , the wickedness which had been committed at Hampton , was noised abroad , even from the shores of Virginia to lake Champlain.
<br>
<br>9 Accordingly all the women and children , who were able , suddenly departed from the place , lest the same thing might , peradventure , happen unto them.
<br>
<br>10 Neither were they deceived in judgment ; for , lo ! when the place was given up , and a covenant made , the servants of the king proved faithless.
<br>
<br>11 They abided not by the contract <span class="delete">;</span> saying , Pish ! ye are but yankees , therefore will we do to you as seemeth meet unto us !
<br>
<br>12 So they burnt the houses , and all other things belonging to the United States , with fire.
<br>
<br>13 After which they fell upon the merchandise , the goods , and the chattles of all manner of persons <span class="delete">; nay ,</span> the persons of some of the women were abused :
<br>
<br>14 Meanwhile they forced others to put the burning brand to their own dwellings ; or pay them tribute.
<br>
<br>15 They killed the cattle , and prepared them food ; and after they had eaten and drank , they overturned the tables.
<br>
<br>16 So when their vengeance was completed , they departed to other places and committed like evils.
<br>
<br>17 About the same time the vessels of the king <span class="delete">,</span> that sailed on the lake , went against the town of Burlington <span class="delete">;</span> where the army of Hampton was.
<br>
<br>18 But when the men of Columbia began to let the destroying engines loose upon them from the strong hold before the town , they fled in dismay.
<br>
<br>19 Now while these things were passing in the north , the greedy sons of Britain were laying desolate the small villages of the south.
<br>
<br>20 On the waters of the Chesapeake they captured the small vessels and made spoil thereof.
<br>
<br>21 Moreover , they gat possession of a small place called Kent Island , and robbed the poor and needy ; for There was no mercy in <span class="delete">them.</span>
<br>
<br>22 Yea , it was said of a truth , and talked abroad , that they came in the night time , and disturbed the small cattle , and the fowls , and took them for their own use , and crawled away like men ashamed ;
<br>
<br>23 Thus committing a sin , by violating the eighth commandment of God , which saith , Thou shalt not STEAL.
<br>
<br>24 Even the state of North-Carolina escaped them not ; they landed a thousand men of war at a place called Ocracocke.
<br>
<br>25 And again the work of destruction began ; they spread terror and dismay whithersoever they went.
<br>
<br>26 They troubled the men of Columbia all along the sea coast , which is more than eight thousand furlongs , from north to south.
<br>
<br>27 Moreover , they gat much plunder <span class="delete">;</span> even much of the good things with which the land of <span class="delete">Columbia</span> aboundeth.

<br>So ,</span> it came to pass , on the thirty and first day of the seventh month , that the vessels of the king came forward against Plattsburgh , which lieth on the borders of the lake.
<br>
<br>And there were none to defend the place ; for the army of Hampton , a chief captain of the United States , was encamped upon the opposite side of the lake , at a place called Burlington , in the state of Vermont.
<br>
<br>And the number of the soldiers of the king that landed at Plattsburgh was more than a thousand men , and the name of their chief captain was Murray.
<br>
<br>And a captain of the United States , whose name was Mooers , a man of valor , strove to gather together the husbandmen of the place <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> but they were not enough.
<br>
<br>So the army of the king captured the place ; and the men of Columbia fled before the men of <span class="delstrike">war of</span> Britain.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the wickedness which had been committed at Hampton , was noised abroad , even from the shores of Virginia to lake Champlain.
<br>
<br>Accordingly <span class="insert">,</span> all the women and children , who were able , suddenly departed from the place , lest the same thing might , peradventure , happen unto them.
<br>
<br>Neither were they deceived in judgment ; for , lo ! when the place was given up , and a covenant made , the servants of the king proved faithless.
<br>
<br>They abided not by the contract <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">:</span> saying , Pish ! ye are but yankees , therefore will we do to you as seemeth meet unto us !
<br>
<br>So they burnt the houses , and all other things belonging to the United States , with fire.
<br>
<br>After which they fell upon the merchandise , the goods , and the chattles of all manner of persons <span class="delstrike">; nay ,</span> <span class="insert">: nay</span> the persons of some of the women were abused :
<br>
<br>Meanwhile they forced others to put the burning brand to their own dwellings ; or pay them tribute.
<br>
<br>They killed the cattle , and prepared them food ; and after they had eaten and drank , they overturned the tables.
<br>
<br>So <span class="insert">,</span> when their vengeance was completed , they departed to other places and committed like evils.
<br>
<br>About the same time the vessels of the king <span class="delstrike">,</span> that sailed on the lake , went against the town of Burlington <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">,</span> where the army of Hampton was.
<br>
<br>But when the men of Columbia began to let the destroying engines loose upon them <span class="insert">,</span> from the strong hold before the town , they fled in dismay.
<br>
<br>Now while these things were passing in the north , the greedy sons of Britain were laying desolate the small villages of the south.
<br>
<br>On the waters of the Chesapeake they captured the small vessels and made spoil thereof.
<br>
<br>Moreover , they gat possession of a small place called Kent Island , and robbed the poor and needy ; for There was no mercy in <span class="delstrike">them.</span> <span class="insert">them ,</span>
<br>
<br>Yea , it was said of a truth , and talked abroad , that they came in the night time , and disturbed the small cattle , and the fowls , and took them for their own use , and crawled away like men ashamed ;
<br>
<br>Thus committing a sin , by violating the eighth commandment of God , which saith , Thou shalt not STEAL.
<br>
<br>Even the state of North-Carolina escaped them not ; they landed a thousand men of war at a place called Ocracocke.
<br>
<br>And again the work of destruction began ; they spread terror and dismay whithersoever they went.
<br>
<br>They troubled the men of Columbia all along the sea coast , which is more than eight thousand furlongs , from north to south.
<br>
<br>Moreover , they gat much plunder <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">:</span> even much of the good things with which the land of <span class="delstrike">Columbia</span> <span class="insert">Colombia</span> aboundeth.

<br>Affairs on Lake Champlain--pillage of Plattsburgh by the British--bombardment of Burlington--depredations committed in the Chesapeake , and along the coast.
<br>
<br>NOW the fighting vessels of Britain began to appear upon the lake , called by the ancient Gauls , Champlain.
<br>
<br>2 And the vessels of war of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lake were not yet prepared for <span class="insert">the</span> battle ; the name of <span class="insert">their commander</span> was McDonough , <span class="insert">a stripling.</span>

<br>Major Croghan defeats the British and Indians , under Gen. Proctor , in their attack on Fort Stephenson , Lower Sandusky.
<br>
<br>NEVERTHELESS , it came to pass , that <span class="delete">Harrison</span> , the chief captain of the north west army , had placed a captain , a young man , in the hold called Fort Stephenson , to defend it.
<br>
<br>2 Now the fort lieth at the western end of the great lake Erie , at a place called Sandusky.
<br>
<br>3 And the number of the soldiers that were with the youth in the hold <span class="delete">,</span> was about an hundred and three score , and they had only one of the destroying engines.
<br>
<br>4 Now the name of the young man was George , and his <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Croghan.
<br>
<br>5 So on the first day of the eighth month , about the going down of the sun , a mighty host from Malden appeared before the <span class="delete">hold:</span>
<br>
<br>6 Even a thousand savages , and about five hundred men of war of Britain ; and Proctor was the commander thereof.
<br>
<br>7 Moreover , they brought the instruments of destruction in great plenty <span class="delete">;</span> even howitzers , which were not known in the days of the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>8 And they had prepared themselves for the fight , and encompassed the place round about , both by land and by water.
<br>
<br>9 After which Proctor sent a message to the brave Croghan , by a captain whose name was Elliot , and the words thereof were in this sort :
<br>
<br>10 Lo ! now ye can neither move to the right nor to the left , to escape , for we have hemmed you in ;
<br>
<br>11 Therefore , that your blood may not be spilt in vain , we command that ye give up the strong hold into the hands of the servants of the king , and become captives.
<br>
<br>12 We have the destroying engines in abundance , and we are a numerous host.
<br>
<br>13 Furthermore , if ye refuse then shall the wild savages be let loose upon you ; and there shall be none left among you to go and tell the tidings <span class="delete">thereof.</span>
<br>
<br>14 But when Croghan heard the message , he answered and said unto Elliot , Get thee now to thy chief captain , and say unto him , I refuse ; neither will I hearken unto him :
<br>
<br>15 And if it be so , that he come against me with his whole host , even then will I not turn aside from the fierce battle ; though his numbers were as the sand on the sea shore.
<br>
<br>16 Lo ! David , of old , with a sling and a stone slew the mighty Goliah : and shall the people of Columbia be afraid , and bow before the tyrants of Europe ?
<br>
<br>17 Then Elliot returned to the army of the king <span class="delete">;</span> and immediately the mouths of their engines were opened against the fort.
<br>
<br>18 And the noise thereof continued a long time <span class="delete">;</span> even until the next day ; but their battering prevailed not.
<br>
<br>19 Now when Proctor saw it was of no avail , he divided his host into two bands , and appointed a captain to each band ; and they moved towards the fort and assailed it with great violence.
<br>
<br>20 But the men of Croghan were prepared for them ; and they let loose their weapons of war upon them , and set their destroying engine to work , and smote the men of Britain , hip and thigh , with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>21 And the deep ditch that surrounded the fort was <span class="delete">strewn</span> with their slain and their wounded.
<br>
<br>22 So the host of Britain were dismayed and overthrown , and fled in confusion from the fort into the forest ; from whence , in the dead of the night , they went into their vessels , and departed from the place.
<br>
<br>23 Now the loss of the men of Britain was about an hundred two score and ten ; and of the men of Columbia there was one slain and seven wounded.
<br>
<br>24 But when Proctor had rested his army he sent a skilful physician to heal the maimed which he had fled from and left behind.
<br>
<br>25 But <span class="delete">Harrison</span> , the chief captain said unto him , Already have my physicians bound up their wounds , and given them bread and wine , and comforted them ; after the manner of our country.
<br>
<br>26 For we suffer not the captives that fall into our hands to be buffeted or maltreated ; neither want they for any thing.
<br>
<br>27 So the physician of the king's army was permitted to return to his own camp.
<br>
<br>28 Moreover , great honor and praise were bestowed upon the brave Croghan , the captain of the fort , for his valiant deeds ; and his name was spoken of with joy throughout the land of Columbia.

<br>British schooner Dominica , of 14 Guns , captured by the privateer Decatur , of 7 guns--U. S. brig Argus captured by the Pelican--capture of the Boxer by the U. S. brig Enterprize.
<br>
<br>NOW the war continued to rage without abatement upon the waters of the great deep ;
<br>
<br>2 And manifold were the evils that came upon the children of men by the means thereof.
<br>
<br>3 Moreover , the great Sanhedrim of the people were forced to bestir themselves ; and they had continued their councils day after day without ceasing.
<br>
<br>4 And it came to pass , that there was a dreadful battle fought between a vessel of the king , and a private vessel of Columbia.
<br>
<br>5 <span class="delete">Now</span> the name of the vessel that fought was Decatur , and the captain's name was Diron , a Gaul.
<br>
<br>6 And it was so , that about the fourth day of the eighth month , the Decatur having sailed out of the haven of Charleston , being in the state of South Carolina , fell in with one of the fighting vessels of the king , called the Dominica.
<br>
<br>7 But the destroying engines of the king's vessel were two fold greater in numbers than those of the Decatur.
<br>
<br>8 Nevertheless , they set them to work , so that they groaned beneath the fire and smoke ;
<br>
<br>9 And in about the space of an hour the Dominica was conquered and taken captive.
<br>
<br>10 For when the vessels came close together , the men smote one another with their swords and weapons of war ; yea , even the balls of iron they cast at each other , with their hands , and slew one another with wonderful slaughter.
<br>
<br>11 Inasmuch as there were slain and maimed of the king three score souls ; those of the Decatur were about a score : moreover the captain of the Dominica was slain.
<br>
<br>12 The fight was an unequal one ; and the bravery of Diron gained him a great name , for he overcame the enemies of freedom ; although their force was greater than his.
<br>
<br>13 After this , on the fourteenth day of the same month , there was another sore battle between a small vessel of the United States , called the Argus <span class="delete">,</span> and the Pelican , a ship of the king.
<br>
<br>14 Now the Pelican was somewhat stronger than the Argus , and they were stubborn and kept the destroying engines to work , with great noise <span class="delete">,</span> about forty and five minutes.
<br>
<br>15 And the brave captain of the Argus , whose name was Allen , was wounded unto death , and the vessel of Columbia was captured by the ship of Britain , the name of the commander whereof was Maples.
<br>
<br>16 Of the men of Columbia six were slain and seventeen wounded ; of the men of Britain the slain and wounded were five.
<br>
<br>17 Now the death of Allen was spoken of with sorrow throughout the land of Columbia , for he had defended the vessel of the United States nobly <span class="delete">:</span> and captured some merchant ships of <span class="delete">Britain.</span>
<br>
<br>18 Even the enemy regarded him for his bravery , for they buried him with <span class="delete">honor</span> in their own country , not far from the place where he became captive , which was in the waters of the king , even in St. George's Channel.
<br>
<br>19 But it came to pass , on the fifth day of the next month , in the same year ,
<br>
<br>20 That a certain small vessel of Columbia , carrying the engines of destruction , commanded by a gallant man , whose name was Burrows , fell in with another small vessel of the king , called the Boxer <span class="delete">,</span> and the captain thereof was a brave man , and his name was Blythe.
<br>
<br>21 In the language of the people of the land , the vessel of Columbia was called the Enterprize.
<br>
<br>22 Now when the vessels drew nigh unto each other the men shouted with loud shouting.
<br>
<br>23 And immediately they let the mischievous engines loose upon one another , with a noise like unto thunder.
<br>
<br>24 But it happened , that in about the space of forty minutes , the Boxer was overcome ; but she was taken somewhat unawares :
<br>
<br>25 For , lo ! the pride of the men of Britain had made them foolish <span class="delete">;</span> and , thinking of conquest , they nailed Britannia's red-cross to the mast of the vessel.
<br>
<br>26 Whereupon , after they were overcome , they cried aloud for mercy , saying ,
<br>
<br>27 Behold ! our colors are fast ; and we cannot quickly unloose them <span class="delete">:</span> nevertheless , we will be prisoners unto you , therefore spare us.
<br>
<br>28 So the brave mariners of Columbia spared them , and stopped the destroying engines ; for their hearts were inclined to mercy.
<br>
<br>29 However , this was another bloody fight ; for there fell of the men of Britain forty that were slain outright , and seventeen were wounded.
<br>
<br>30 And the loss of Columbia in slain and maimed was about fourteen.
<br>
<br>31 And the commanders of both vessels were slain ; and they buried them with honor in the town of Portland , which leaveth Boston to the west ; for the battle was fought hard by.
<br>
<br>32 Moreover , the great Sanhedrim was pleased with the thing , and gave unto the kinsman of Burrows a medal of gold , in token of remembrance thereof.*
<br>
<br>* Mathew L. Davis , of New-York , <span class="delete">passing by an dobserving</span> the burial place of Burrows <span class="delete">, stopt and ordered a monumen to be erected in his memory</span> at his own <span class="delete">private expense.</span>

<br>Moreover , the great Sanhedrim of the people were forced to bestir themselves ; and they had continued their councils day after day without ceasing.
<br>
<br>And it came to pass , that there was a dreadful battle fought between a vessel of the king , and a private vessel of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>Now</span> <span class="insert"><br>And</span> the name of the vessel that fought was Decatur , and the captain's name was Diron , a Gaul.
<br>
<br>And it was so , that about the fourth day of the eighth month , the Decatur having sailed out of the haven of Charleston , being in the state of South Carolina , fell in with one of the fighting vessels of the king , called the Dominica.
<br>
<br>But the destroying engines of the king's vessel were two fold greater in numbers than those of the Decatur.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , they set them to work , so that they groaned beneath the fire and smoke ;
<br>
<br>And in about the space of an hour the Dominica was conquered and taken captive.
<br>
<br>For when the vessels came close together , the men smote one another with their swords and weapons of war ; yea , even the balls of iron they cast at each other , with their hands , and slew one another with wonderful slaughter.
<br>
<br>Inasmuch as there were slain and maimed of the king three score souls ; those of the Decatur were about a score : moreover the captain of the Dominica was slain.
<br>
<br>The fight was an unequal one ; and the bravery of Diron gained him a great name , for he overcame the enemies of freedom ; although their force was greater than his.
<br>
<br>After this , on the fourteenth day of the same month , there was another sore battle between a small vessel of the United States , called the Argus <span class="delstrike">,</span> and the Pelican , a ship of the king.
<br>
<br>Now the Pelican was somewhat stronger than the Argus , and they were stubborn and kept the destroying engines to work , with great noise <span class="delstrike">,</span> about forty and five minutes.
<br>
<br>And the brave captain of the Argus , whose name was Allen , was wounded unto death , and the vessel of Columbia was captured by the ship of Britain , the name of the commander whereof was Maples.
<br>
<br>Of the men of Columbia six were slain and seventeen wounded ; of the men of Britain the slain and wounded were five.
<br>
<br>Now the death of Allen was spoken of with sorrow throughout the land of Columbia , for he had defended the vessel of the United States nobly <span class="delstrike">:</span> <span class="insert">;</span> and captured some merchant ships of <span class="delstrike">Britain.</span> <span class="insert">Britain ,</span>
<br>
<br>Even the enemy regarded him for his bravery , for they buried him with <span class="delstrike">honor</span> <span class="insert">honour</span> in their own country , not far from the place where he became captive , which was in the waters of the king , even in St. George's Channel.
<br>
<br>But it came to pass , on the fifth day of the next month , in the same year ,
<br>
<br>That a certain small vessel of Columbia , carrying the engines of destruction , commanded by a gallant man , whose name was Burrows , fell in with another small vessel of the king , called the Boxer <span class="delstrike">,</span> and the captain thereof was a brave man , and his name was Blythe.
<br>
<br>In the language of the people of the land , the vessel of Columbia was called the Enterprize.
<br>
<br>Now when the vessels drew nigh unto each other the men shouted with loud shouting.
<br>
<br>And immediately they let the mischievous engines loose upon one another , with a noise like unto thunder.
<br>
<br>But it happened , that in about the space of forty minutes , the Boxer was overcome ; but she was taken somewhat unawares :
<br>
<br>For , lo ! the pride of the men of Britain had made them foolish <span class="delstrike">;</span> <span class="insert">:</span> and , thinking of <span class="insert">the</span> conquest , they nailed Britannia's red-cross to the mast of the vessel.
<br>
<br>Whereupon , after they were overcome , they cried aloud for mercy , saying ,
<br>
<br>Behold ! our colors are fast ; and we cannot quickly unloose them <span class="delstrike">:</span> <span class="insert">;</span> nevertheless , we will be prisoners unto you , therefore spare us.
<br>
<br>So the brave mariners of Columbia spared them , and stopped the destroying engines ; for their hearts were inclined to mercy.
<br>
<br>However , this was another bloody fight ; for there fell of the men of Britain forty that were slain outright , and seventeen were wounded.
<br>
<br>And the loss of Columbia in slain and maimed was about fourteen.
<br>
<br>And the commanders of both vessels were slain ; and they buried them with honor in the town of Portland , which leaveth Boston to the west ; for the battle was fought hard by.
<br>
<br>Moreover , the great Sanhedrim was pleased with the thing , and gave unto the <span class="insert">least</span> kinsman of Burrows a medal of gold , in token of remembrance thereof.*

<br>The capture of the British Fleet on Lake Erie <span class="delete">,</span> by the American Fleet under Com. Perry.
<br>
<br>THE Lord , in the plenitude of his wisdom and power , ordaineth all things which come to pass : and the doings are for the benefit of man , and for the glory of God.
<br>
<br>2 For where is the evil which hath not turned to an advantage , and been a warning , and swallowed up the evil that might have come ?
<br>
<br>3 Now about this time the strong vessels of Columbia <span class="delete">,</span> that moved upon the face of the blue waters of the great lake Erie , were given in charge to Oliver , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Perry.
<br>
<br>4 And he was a prudent man , and had prepared himself to meet the vessels of the king , even forty days before hand.
<br>
<br>5 And the name of the captain of the fleet of Britain was Barclay , a man of great valor ; but he boasted and was vain of his fleet , for it was more powerful than the fleet of Columbia.
<br>
<br>6 Nevertheless , it came to pass , in the one thousand eight hundred and thirteenth year , on the tenth day of the ninth month , early in the morning , about the rising of the sun ,
<br>
<br>7 The valiant Perry beheld the fleet of the king at a distance upon the lake ; so he unmoored his <span class="delete">vessel</span> and went out to meet them in battle array , fleet against fleet.
<br>
<br>8 And when their white sails were spread upon the bosom of the lake , they appeared like unto a squadron of passing clouds.
<br>
<br>9 A gentle breeze wafted the hostile vessels towards one another.
<br>
<br>10 It was silence upon the waters ; save when the sound of musical instruments fell sweetly upon the ear.
<br>
<br>11 But it happened , a little before the midday , that the shouts of the men of war of Britain were heard , and the shouts of the men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>12 And now the destroying engines began to utter their thunders <span class="delete">,</span> vomiting forth fire and smoke and brimstone in abundance.
<br>
<br>13 And suddenly the waters were in an uproar ; and the bellowing <span class="delete">noise</span> sounded along the lake.
<br>
<br>14 Moreover , the chief force of the ships of the king was put against the vessel in which Perry was ;
<br>
<br>15 And the vessel was called the Lawrence , after a brave man , whose dying words waved upon her <span class="delete">,</span> aloft :
<br>
<br>16 Now , behold , a thousand balls of iron <span class="delete">,</span> skim the surface of the waters , swift as shooting stars.
<br>
<br>17 But when the battle waxed hot , and Perry saw that the tackling of his vessel was shot away , and his men were slain and wounded with great slaughter , and his destroying engines became silent ,
<br>
<br>18 He put the charge of the vessel into the hands of one of his officers , whose name was Yarnell , a trusty man <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>19 Then , with the starry banner of Columbia in his hand , did the gallant Perry leap into his cock-boat , while his brave mariners quickly conveyed him to another fighting vessel of the United States <span class="delete">,</span> called the Niagara , commanded by a valiant man whose name was Elliot.
<br>
<br>20 After this again the vessels uttered their thunders and fought hard , and the men of Columbia poured out destruction upon the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>21 And it came to pass , that the skilful contrivance of Perry , and the bravery of his men , at length forced the whole fleet of the king to become <span class="delete">captive , even</span> unto the cock boats of Columbia.
<br>
<br>22 Thus again was the mighty lion humbled before the eagle : for six strong vessels of Britain were overcome at one time.
<br>
<br>23 And the slain and wounded of the king that day , was an hundred thirty and five ; <span class="delete">besides there were about</span> a thousand prisoners.
<br>
<br>24 The loss of the United States was twenty and seven that were killed , and four score and ten were wounded.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , the number of the men of Britain made captive was more than all the men of Perry's squadron.
<br>
<br>26 Now Perry was a righteous man , and <span class="delete">,</span> like the good Samaritan , took care of the halt and maimed , and put skilful men to bind up their wounds ; and the men of Britain blessed him.
<br>
<br>27 Neither was he a man puffed up with vanity , even in the hour of victory <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>28 For when he had conquered the fleet of Britain , he wrote to Jones ,* one of the scribes of the great Sanhedrim , with modesty , saying ,
<br>
<br>* W. Jones , Secretary of the Navy.
<br>
<br>29 To day it hath pleased the Lord that the people of Columbia should triumph over their enemies.
<br>
<br>30 At the same time he wrote to Harrison , the chief captain of the host of Columbia , whose army was at the bay of Sandusky , saying , we have met the enemy , and they are ours !
<br>
<br>31 Then did the enemies of Columbia weep ; and the gainsayer put on deep mourning.
<br>
<br>32 Moreover , the great Sanhedrim honored Perry with great honor ; <span class="delete">yea , they thanked him ,</span> and gave him medals , with devices curiously wrought.
<br>
<br>33 Likewise , the people gave him much silver plate , with gravings thereon , mentioning his deeds.
<br>
<br>34 And the bye stander might read his triumph <span class="delete">in</span> his country's eyes.
<br>
<br>35 His sons shall hear him spoken of with pleasure <span class="delete">;</span> and his name shall be mentioned in the song of the virgins.
<br>
<br>36 Where , oh ! <span class="delete">Albion</span> , are now thy mighty admirals ? where thy Nelson ? where the transcendant glory they gained for thee ?
<br>
<br>37 Alas ! it hath expired upon the waters of Erie <span class="delete">,</span> before the destroying engines of Perry !

<br>26 Now Perry was a righteous man , and like the good Samaritan , took care of the halt and maimed , and put skilful men to bind up their wounds ; and the men of Britain blessed him.
<br>
<br>27 Neither was he a man puffed up with vanity , even in the hour of victory <span class="insert">;</span>
<br>
<br>28 For when he had conquered the fleet of Britain , he wrote to Jones ,* one of the scribes of the great Sanhedrim , with modesty , saying ,
<br>
<br>* W. Jones , Secretary of the Navy.
<br>
<br>29 To day it hath pleased the Lord that the people of Columbia should triumph over their enemies.
<br>
<br>30 At the same time he wrote to Harrison , the chief captain of the host of Columbia , whose army was at the bay of Sandusky , saying , we have met the enemy , and they are ours !
<br>
<br>31 Then did the enemies of Columbia weep ; and the gainsayer put on deep mourning.
<br>
<br>32 Moreover , the great Sanhedrim honored Perry with great honor ; and gave him medals , with devices curiously wrought.
<br>
<br>33 Likewise , the people gave him much silver plate , with gravings thereon , mentioning his deeds.
<br>
<br>34 And the bye stander might read his triumph <span class="insert">;</span> his country's eyes.
<br>
<br>35 His sons shall hear him spoken of with pleasure <span class="insert">,</span> and his name shall be mentioned in the song of the virgins.
<br>
<br>36 Where , oh ! <span class="insert">Britain</span> , are now thy mighty admirals ? where thy Nelson ? where the transcendant glory they gained for thee ?
<br>
<br>37 Alas ! it hath expired upon the waters of Erie before the destroying engines of Perry !

<br>Capture of Maiden and Detroit--the army of Gen. Proctor retreat towards the Moravian towns--Gen. Harrison pursues them.
<br>
<br>NOW when Perry had taken care of the captives , and the wounded , and set them upon the shore ,
<br>
<br>2 He began to convey the army of Harrison from Fort Meigs and round about.
<br>
<br>3 And having gathered them together into his vessels , he brought them , and landed them nigh unto the strong hold of Maiden.
<br>
<br>4 And it came to pass , on the twenty-third day of the same month , in which Perry conquered the fleet of Britain ,
<br>
<br>5 That Harrison , the chief captain , began to march the host of Columbia against the strong hold of Maiden , and captured a town called <span class="delete">Amherstburgh</span> , nigh thereunto.
<br>
<br>6 Now Proctor was the chief captain of the savages and servants of the king.
<br>
<br>7 And when he saw the men of Columbia approach , he destroyed the fort , the tents , and the store-houses of the king , and , with his whole host , fled swiftly towards Sandwich.
<br>
<br>8 And Harrison , and the host of Columbia , followed hard after him.
<br>
<br>9 Now when the savages of the wilderness beheld the men of Britain flee before the <span class="delete">children</span> of Columbia , their spirits sunk , and they were sore amazed.*
<br>
<br>* See Tecumseh's letter to Proctor.
<br>
<br>10 Moreover , they upbraided the servants of the king , saying , Lo ! ye have deceived us , and led us from our hunting grounds , and we are an <span class="delete">hungered:</span>
<br>
<br>11 For , verily , ye promised us bread and wine ,* and silver and gold ; yea , even that we should drink of the strong waters of Jamaica , if we would go out with you and fight the battles of the king , against the men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>* At this time <span class="delete">it will be remembered</span> the British army were short of supplies.
<br>
<br>12 But , behold ! now ye would run away and leave us to fight alone.
<br>
<br>13 Whereupon many of their tribes cast away their tomahawks , and refused to fight under the banners of the king.
<br>
<br>14 And when Harrison came to Sandwich , Proctor and his army had departed from the place , and fled towards the river Thames , near Moravian Town.
<br>
<br>15 (Now the Thames emptieth its waters into the lake St. Clair , and the Moravian Towns lie upon the river , about an hundred miles from Maiden , towards the north in the province of Upper Canada.)
<br>
<br>16 Moreover , as they journied on , the brave <span class="delete">McArthur</span> crossed over with his band to the strong hold of Detroit , and took it.
<br>
<br>17 But the savages and the men of Britain had destroyed those things which they could not carry away , and fled in haste.
<br>
<br>18 So <span class="delete">M'Arthur</span> , in whom the chief captain put much faith , remained at Detroit in the charge thereof.
<br>
<br>19 And it came to pass , when Harrison saw that the host of Britain fled before him , he departed from Sandwich and went after them ; it being on the second day of the next month.
<br>
<br>20 And his whole army followed after him , in all about three thousand brave men from the back-woods of the state of Kentucky and the pleasant villages of Ohio.
<br>
<br>21 Now Harrison was a mighty man of valor , and no man could make him afraid ; and the captains and officers that were with him were all valiant men.
<br>
<br>22 And , when some of his captains said unto him , Lo ! There is a feast today <span class="delete">;</span> go thou and partake thereof , and refresh thyself , and we will watch ;
<br>
<br>23 He answered and said unto them , Nay , shall I go and riot , whilst the warriors of Columbia lie on the frozen ground ?
<br>
<br>24 No , their fate shall be my fate ; and their glory shall be my glory.
<br>
<br>25 So he wrapped himself in his cloak , and lay down in his own tent.
<br>
<br>26 And the husbandmen of Kentucky were led on by their valiant governor , whose name was Shelby , and he was a man well stricken in years ; even at the age of threescore did he go out against the enemies of Columbia ; and all the people rejoiced in him.
<br>
<br>27 And the gallant Perry staid not behind ; but freely offered his strength , and was one of the right hand men of Harrison , with whom he followed after the host of Britain.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> Nevertheless , it happened that a band of the savages strove to give hindrance to the army of <span class="delete">Columbia.

<br>Battle of the Thames--Gen. Harrison captures the British army under Gen. Proctor--illuminations on account of it--news of it received in England.
<br>
<br>AND it came to pass , on the fifth day of the same month , that Proctor , with the savages and the army of the king , rested upon advantageous ground , on the banks of the river Thames ,
<br>
<br>2 Where he drew his army up in the order of battle <span class="delete">,</span> after the fashion of these days , and prepared himself to meet the host of <span class="delete">Columbia.</span>
<br>
<br>3 Now the army of Proctor was mighty ; for he had a thousand horsemen : but the number of the savages that followed after him are not known to this time ; howbeit , they were many.
<br>
<br>4 And they were under the charge of a chief warrior , whom they called Tecumseh , a savage whom the king had made a chief captain.*
<br>
<br>* Brig. General.
<br>
<br>5 And it came to pass , on the same day , in the latter part of the day , the army of Harrison drew nigh unto the place.
<br>
<br>6 And he called together his captains of fifties , and his squadrons , and encouraged them , and commanded them to prepare themselves for the fight.
<br>
<br>7 And he put the host of Columbia in battle array against the host of Britain , army against army.
<br>
<br>8 Now the sound of the trumpet , the cymbal , the bugle-horn , and the noisy drum , echoed through the deep wilderness.
<br>
<br>9 And the red savages appeared in the field before the men of Britain , for they had put them <span class="delete">,</span> as a shield , <span class="delete">in</span> the front of the battle.
<br>
<br>10 And they yelled with dreadful yellings , and sounded aloud the war-whoop , which was the signal of death.
<br>
<br>11 But the army of <span class="delete">Columbia</span> rushed upon them with the fierceness of lions.
<br>
<br>12 And the weapons of war were used without mercy ; the foxes and the beavers crept into their holes , for the destroying engines frightened the wild beasts , so that they looked for their hiding places.
<br>
<br>13 The gallant Johnson* fell upon them with a band of chosen horsemen , and he drove them before him like chaff before the wind , and smote their chief warrior ,** and slew him with his own hand , so that he fell to the earth.
<br>
<br>* Col. Johnson , of the Kentucky light-horse.
<br>
<br>** Tecumseh ; who was at that moment in the act of shooting the colonel.
<br>
<br>14 And the host of Columbia assailed the men of Britain on all sides , and overcame them and made them prisoners of war ; whereupon the engines ceased to utter their thunders.
<br>
<br>15 Howbeit , Proctor escaped , on a swift running horse , with a handful of his captains that were under him.
<br>
<br>16 Now the number of prisoners captured by the army of <span class="delete">Harison</span> that day were about six hundred.
<br>
<br>17 And the slain and wounded of the men of Britain were thirty and three ; and the same number of savages were slain.
<br>
<br>18 Of the army of Columbia seven were slain and two score and two were wounded.
<br>
<br>19 But the men of Kentucky and Ohio , whose sons and brothers and fathers had been inhumanly slaughtered at the River Raisin , slew not a single captive.
<br>
<br>20 But they treated them as men ; thus <span class="delete">doing</span> good for evil <span class="delete">;</span> according to the word of the Lord.
<br>
<br>21 Moreover , they captured six of the destroying engines that were made of brass , and two that were made of iron ; besides many weapons of war.
<br>
<br>22 Now three of the brass engines were those given to the men of Britain , at the capture of Detroit , the first year of the war , and were the same that had been taken from the king in the days of Washington.
<br>
<br>23 Soon after the battle , Harrison returned with his army to Detroit , where many of the savages had assembled , to repent of their evils , and ask for mercy from the chief captain.
<br>
<br>24 So Harrison made a covenant with them , and they were thankful , and gave him hostages.
<br>
<br>25 Now there were great rejoicings <span class="delete">among the children</span> of Columbia , and the hearts of the people <span class="delete">of the United States were exceeding glad.</span>
<br>
<br>26 So that when the news thereof reached them they drank wine ; and when the evening came they lighted their candles , and put them in candlesticks of silver and candlesticks of <span class="delete">gold.</span>
<br>
<br>27 And there were many thousands of them ; and the light thereof was as though the stars had fallen from heaven.
<br>
<br>28 This did they throughout the land of Columbia , from the district of Maine , in the east , to the state of Georgia , in the south.
<br>
<br>29 <span class="delete">But the sect of the tories shut their eyes ; neither would they go out to behold the glory of the light thereof.
<br>
<br>30 Moreover</span> , when the Prince Regent , and the chief counsellors , and the wise men of Britain , heard the tidings , for a truth , that their fleet and their army were captured , they were astonished beyond measure.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>31</span> They looked at one another like men who had lost their wits : they were silent , and their tongues clave to the roof of their mouths.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> Their knees smote one against another , for the strength of Britain was shaken ; her valiant warriors lost their honor ;* and her glory was outshone.
<br>
<br>* Doubly lost it : by water and by land ; by being conquered and by being cruel.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33 Now there were great honor</span> and praise bestowed upon Harrison for his courage , and his valiant acts and the people remembered his name with pleasure.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>34</span> Moreover , he gave great praise to Shelby , the governor , and Perry , and Johnson , and all the brave men that were with him.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33</span> And in the same month , when the object of the army was fulfilled , the husbandmen of Columbia returned every man to his own house.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> But Harrison and Perry , and the band of warriors of the great Sanhedrim , went into their vessels.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>37</span> And they moved from Detroit and came in the ships of Perry <span class="delete">to Buffalo</span> , nigh unto the river Niagara , to meet Wilkinson , who came from the south , and was appointed chief captain of the army of the centre.

<br>
<br>Battle of the Thames--Gen. Harrison captures the British army under Gen. Proctor--illuminations on account of it--news of it received in England.
<br>
<br>AND it came to pass , on the fifth day of the same month , that Proctor , with the savages and the army of the king , rested upon advantageous ground , on the banks of the river Thames ,
<br>
<br>2 Where he drew his army up in the order of battle after the fashion of these days , and prepared himself to meet the host of <span class="insert">Columbia ,</span>
<br>
<br>3 Now the army of Proctor was mighty ; for he had a thousand horsemen : but the number of the savages that followed after him are not known to this time ; howbeit , they were many.
<br>
<br>4 And they were under the charge of a chief warrior , whom they called Tecumseh , a savage whom the king had made a chief captain.*
<br>
<br>* Brig. General.
<br>
<br>5 And it came to pass , on the same day , in the latter part of the day , <span class="insert">that</span> the army of Harrison drew nigh unto the place.
<br>
<br>6 And he called together his captains of fifties , and his squadrons , and encouraged them , and commanded them to prepare themselves for the fight.
<br>
<br>7 And he put the host of Columbia in battle array against the host of Britain , army against army.
<br>
<br>8 Now the sound of the trumpet , the cymbal , the bugle-horn , and the noisy drum , echoed through the deep wilderness.
<br>
<br>9 And the red savages appeared in the field before the men of Britain , for they had put them as a shield , <span class="insert">at</span> the front of the battle.
<br>
<br>10 And they yelled with dreadful yellings , and sounded aloud the war-whoop , which was the signal of death.
<br>
<br>11 But the army of <span class="insert">Colombia</span> rushed upon them with the fierceness of lions.
<br>
<br>12 And the weapons of war were used without mercy ; the foxes and the beavers crept into their holes , for the destroying engines frightened the wild beasts , so that they looked for their hiding places.
<br>
<br>13 The gallant Johnson* fell upon them with a band of chosen horsemen , and he drove them before him like chaff before the wind , and smote their chief warrior ,** and slew him with his own hand , so that he fell to the earth.
<br>
<br>* Col. Johnson , of the Kentucky light-horse.
<br>
<br>** Tecumseh ; who was at that moment in the act of shooting the colonel.
<br>
<br>14 And the host of Columbia assailed the men of Britain on all sides , and overcame them <span class="insert">,</span> and made them prisoners of war ; whereupon the engines ceased to utter their thunders.
<br>
<br>15 Howbeit , Proctor escaped , on a swift running horse , with a handful of his captains that were under him.
<br>
<br>16 Now the number of prisoners captured by the army of <span class="insert">Harrison</span> that day were about six hundred.
<br>
<br>17 And the slain and wounded of the men of Britain were thirty and three ; and the same number of savages were slain.
<br>
<br>18 Of the army of Columbia seven were slain and two score and two were wounded.
<br>
<br>19 But the men of Kentucky and Ohio , whose sons and brothers and fathers had been inhumanly slaughtered at the River Raisin , slew not a single captive.
<br>
<br>20 But they treated them as men ; thus <span class="insert">rendering</span> good for evil <span class="insert">,</span> according to the word of the Lord.
<br>
<br>21 Moreover , they captured six of the destroying engines that were made of brass , and two that were made of iron ; besides many weapons of war.
<br>
<br>22 Now three of the brass engines were those given to the men of Britain , at the capture of Detroit , the first year of the war , and were the same that had been taken from the king in the days of Washington.
<br>
<br>23 Soon after the battle , Harrison returned with his army to Detroit , where many of the savages had assembled , to repent of their evils , and ask for mercy from the chief captain.
<br>
<br>24 So Harrison made a covenant with them , and they were thankful , and gave him hostages.
<br>
<br>25 Now there were great rejoicings <span class="insert">in the land</span> of Columbia , and the hearts of the people <span class="insert">were exceeding glad ,</span>
<br>
<br>26 So that when the news thereof reached them they drank wine ; and when the evening came they lighted their candles , and put them in candlesticks of silver and candlesticks of <span class="insert">gold , and placed them in the windows of their houses.</span>
<br>
<br>27 And there were many thousands of them ; and the light thereof was as though the stars had fallen from heaven.
<br>
<br>28 This did they throughout the land of Columbia , from the district of Maine , in the east , to the state of Georgia , in the south.
<br>
<br>29 <span class="insert">And</span> , when the Prince Regent , and the chief counsellors , and the wise men of Britain , heard the tidings , for a truth , that their fleet and their army were captured , they were astonished beyond measure.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>30</span> They looked at one another like men who had lost their wits : they were silent , and their tongues clave to the roof of their mouths.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>31</span> Their knees smote one against another , for the strength of Britain was shaken ; her valiant warriors <span class="insert">had</span> lost their honor ;* and her glory was outshone.
<br>
<br>* Doubly lost it : by water and by land ; by being conquered <span class="insert">,</span> and by being cruel.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>32 Now there was great honour</span> and praise bestowed upon Harrison for his courage , and his valiant acts <span class="insert">;</span> and the people remembered his name with pleasure.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>33</span> Moreover , he gave great praise to Shelby , the governor , and Perry , and Johnson , and all the brave men that were with him.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>34</span> And in the same month , when the object of the army was fulfilled , the husbandmen of Columbia returned every man to his own house.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>35</span> But Harrison and Perry , and the band of warriors of the great Sanhedrim , went into their vessels.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>36</span> And they moved from Detroit <span class="insert">,</span> and came in the ships of Perry <span class="insert">, to Buffaloe</span> , nigh unto the river Niagara , to meet Wilkinson , who came from the south , and was appointed chief captain of the army of the centre.

<br>War with the Creek Nation of Indians--massacre <span class="delete">of</span> Fort Mimms--Georgia and Tennessee militia , under General Jackson <span class="delete">,</span> retaliate.
<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , while these things were going on in the north , and the repentant savages laid their murderous weapons at the feet of Harrison ,
<br>
<br>2 That the servants of the king were stirring up the spirit of Satan in the savages of the wilderness of the south ;
<br>
<br>3 And placing the destroying engines into their hands that they might <span class="delete">drink</span> the blood of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>4 Now <span class="delete">those</span> southern barbarians were called the Creek nation of Indians.
<br>
<br>5 Moreover , they were a nation of savages that dwelt in the back-woods and the wilderness round about the states of Georgia , Tennessee , and the Mississippi Territory.
<br>
<br>6 So about this time they took their weapons of death in their hands , and went against the strong hold of Fort Mimms , which lieth on a branch of the river Mobile , <span class="delete">which</span> emptieth its waters into the great Gulf of Mexico.
<br>
<br>7 And they captured the place ; and with the fury of demons they murdered , with the tomahawk , the men , the women , and the infants that were in and about the fort , sparing neither age nor sex ; and slaying the prisoners that begged for mercy.
<br>
<br>8 And the number of the people of Columbia that were massacred and burnt alive in their houses , that day , was about four hundred ; however , there were an hundred savages slain.
<br>
<br>9 For it was a sore fight ; and <span class="delete">Beasley</span> , who commanded the fort , fought hard against them ; howbeit , he was slain.
<br>
<br>10 But it came to pass , in the same year that the people of Columbia were revenged of the evil <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>11 Andrew , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Jackson , a man of courage and valor , was chief captain in the south <span class="delete">,</span>
<br>
<br>12 And he sent out one of his brave captains , whose name was Coffee , with a strong band ; even nine hundred mighty horsemen :
<br>
<br>13 Now these were the valiant husbandmen of Georgia and the back-woods of Tennessee ; their horses were fleet as the roe-buck ; their weapons of war were certain death.
<br>
<br>14 So they went forth against a town of the savages called Tallushatches , on the second day of the eleventh month.
<br>
<br>15 And on the next day they encompassed the town round about ; and the savages prepared themselves for battle.
<br>
<br>16 About the rising of the sun they sounded their drums , and began their horrible yellings.
<br>
<br>17 But they frightened not the hearts of the brave men of Tennessee.
<br>
<br>18 So when Coffee had stationed his captains and his men of war about the town , in the order of battle , the whole army shouted aloud ;
<br>
<br>19 And the instruments of destruction were let loose upon them on all sides ; and they fought with all their might.
<br>
<br>20 But the men of Columbia rushed upon them , and subdued them , and made about four score women and children captive.
<br>
<br>21 And slew about two hundred of their warriors <span class="delete">;</span> leaving not a man to tell the tidings.
<br>
<br>22 For , lo ! when the savages of the wilderness commit great evils and transgressions against the people of Columbia ,
<br>
<br>23 The great Sanhedrim of the people send out mighty armies against them , that are able to overthrow them , and make their towns a desolation , and lay waste their habitations.
<br>
<br>24 Now the loss of the army of Columbia that day , was five slain and about forty wounded.
<br>
<br>25 And Jackson , the chief captain , gave great praise to Coffee , and all the valiant men that fought that <span class="delete">day.</span>
<br>
<br>26 On the next day after the battle , the army of Columbia returned to their camp , at a place called the Ten-Islands.

<br>Continuation of the War with the Creeks--Gen. Jackson's <span class="delete">grand</span> victory over them--they sue for peace--a treaty is concluded with them.
<br>
<br>NOTWITHSTANDING their discomfiture , the nation of the Creeks were still bent on warring against the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>2 And they committed many outrages upon the inhabitants of the states round about.
<br>
<br>3 But it came to pass , on the seventh day of the same month , that a messenger came to Jackson , the chief captain , and spake unto him , saying :
<br>
<br>4 Lo ! even now , more than a thousand savages have pitched their tents at Talledoga , near the strong hold of Lashley , with intent to assail it.
<br>
<br>5 Immediately Jackson took two thousand hardy men , who were called volunteers , because they <span class="delete">fought freely for their country</span> and led them against the savages.
<br>
<br>6 Now the men of war that followed after him were mostly from the state of Tennessee , and men of dauntless courage.
<br>
<br>7 So , early in the morning of the next day , the army of Jackson drew nigh the place , in battle array.
<br>
<br>8 And the savages came out towards the army of Columbia , with shouting and yellings : and again the engines of destruction were used plentifully.
<br>
<br>9 And the leaden balls whizzed about their ears like unto a nest of hornets.
<br>
<br>10 But the horsemen , and the whole army of Jackson , rushed upon the savages , and slew them with great slaughter , and overcame them.
<br>
<br>11 And the number of savages slain that day was about three hundred ; and a red-cross banner of the Spanish nation was found amongst them and taken.
<br>
<br>12 Seventeen of the men of Columbia were slain <span class="delete">,</span> and about four score wounded.
<br>
<br>13 So , when the battle was over , Jackson returned to his own camp.
<br>
<br>14 After these things had come to pass , on the twelfth day of the month , a certain captain , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was White , was sent against another place called the Hillabee-Towns.
<br>
<br>15 And , on the eighteenth day of the same month , he took the towns , and destroyed them , and slew three score of the savages , and made about two hundred two score and ten prisoners.
<br>
<br>16 About eleven days afterwards , a valiant captain , whose name was Floyd , with his brave men , went against the towns of Autossee and Tallisee , which lie on the banks of the river Tallapoosie.
<br>
<br>17 And Floyd went against them with boldness <span class="delete">,</span> and triumphed over them <span class="delete">,</span> and killed about two hundred of them , and burned their towns with fire , and slew the king of Autossee , and the king of Tallisee , who were the kings of two tribes.
<br>
<br>18 Moreover , on the thirteenth day of the next month , Claiborne , a governor , and a man of valor , went against the savages that dwelt on the river <span class="delete">Alabama ;</span>
<br>
<br>19 And he marched with his army through the wilderness more than an hundred miles , to a town built upon a place called by the savages the Holy-Ground , where three of the Indian prophets dwelt.
<br>
<br>20 Now there were lying prophets among the savages , even as there were in the days of old ; and they prophesied according to their own wishes ;
<br>
<br>21 And those of shallow understanding believed them , and were led into a snare , whereby their whole tribe was nigh being destroyed.
<br>
<br>22 And Wetherford , the chief warrior of the Creek nation , was there also with his band.
<br>
<br>23 And he fought hard against Claiborne ; but he was overthrown , and fled , and the town was burnt , even two hundred houses.
<br>
<br>24 <span class="delete">After</span> all these tribulations , the depredations of the savages of the south were not stayed.
<br>
<br>25 So Jackson , the chief captain , went out against them with his army , and attacked them at their strong hold on the waters of the Tallapoosie , where they were entrenched , <span class="delete">having</span> more than a thousand warriors.
<br>
<br>26 Now this was on the twenty and seventh day of the third month , in the one thousand eight hundred and fourteenth year of the <span class="delete">age of Christianity.</span>
<br>
<br>27 And Jackson set his destroying engines to work , and fought desperately against them , for about the space of five hours ; when he overcame them , so that only about a score escaped.
<br>
<br>28 Seven hundred and fifty of the savage warriors were found slain in battle ; and two hundred two score and ten women and children became captives to the army of Columbia.
<br>
<br>29 Manahoee <span class="delete">,</span> their chief prophet , was smitten in the mouth <span class="delete">,</span> and slain , and two other false prophets were slain with him.
<br>
<br>30 Moreover , about the first day of the sixth month , a brave man , whose name was Pearson , with the husbandmen of the states of North and South Carolina , went against them along the borders of the Alabama , and captured about six hundred of them.
<br>
<br>31 Thus did the men of Columbia triumph over them , and conquer them , even to the seventh time.
<br>
<br>32 And so the judgment of the Lord fell upon them for their unrighteousness , and for their wicked and murderous deeds.
<br>
<br>33 After which they repented of their evil , having , through their own folly , lost many thousand warriors.
<br>
<br>34 And <span class="delete">the</span> chief warriors gave up their instruments of destruction , and laid them at the feet of Jackson , the chief captain.
<br>
<br>35 Even <span class="delete">Wetherford</span> , the chief warrior , gave himself up to Jackson , saying , I fought with my might ; but I have brought evil upon my nation ; and thou hast slain my warriors ; and I <span class="delete">am overcome.</span>
<br>
<br>36 Now the savages are easily inflamed and roused to works of sin and death ; and of their weakness the servants of the king are not ashamed to take advantage ; even to the ruin of the poor and ignorant barbarians.
<br>
<br>37 So the warriors and the whole nation of the Creeks , being tired of a destructive war , entreated the men of Columbia for peace , saying unto Jackson ,
<br>
<br>38 Lo ! now are our eyes opened to our own profit ; now will we make peace with you.
<br>
<br>39 And if ye will no more suffer the fire , and the sword , and the destroying engines to spread desolation amongst us ,
<br>
<br>40 Then will we make a covenant with you , and give you for an inheritance a great part of the land which our fathers inherited before us.
<br>
<br>41 And the length and the breadth thereof shall be about as large as the whole island of Britain , whose men of war have led us into this snare.
<br>
<br>42 For although the king , who calleth himself our father , across the great waters , did put the instruments of death into our hands , and give us the black dust in abundance ; nevertheless he deceived us ; and in the hour of danger his servants left us to take care of ourselves.
<br>
<br>43 So Jackson made a covenant with them <span class="delete">,</span> and it was signed by the chiefs of their nation.
<br>
<br>44 And after it had been examined by the wise men and the great Sanhedrim of the people , it was signed with the hand-writing of James , the chief governor of the land of Columbia.

<br>And the savages came out towards the army of Columbia , with shouting and yellings : and again the engines of destruction were used plentifully.
<br>
<br>And the leaden balls whizzed about their ears like unto a nest of hornets.
<br>
<br>But the horsemen , and the whole army of Jackson , rushed upon the savages , and slew them with great slaughter , and overcame them.
<br>
<br>And the number of savages slain that day was about three hundred ; and a red-cross banner of the Spanish nation was found amongst them <span class="insert">,</span> and taken.
<br>
<br>Seventeen of the men of Columbia were slain <span class="delstrike">,</span> and about four score wounded.
<br>
<br>So , when the battle was over , Jackson returned to his own camp.
<br>
<br>After these things had come to pass , on the twelfth day of the month , a certain captain , whose <span class="delstrike">sur-name</span> <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was White , was sent against another place called the Hillabee-Towns.
<br>
<br>And , on the eighteenth day of the same month , he took the towns , and destroyed them , and slew three score of the savages , and made about two hundred two score and ten prisoners.
<br>
<br>About eleven days afterwards , a valiant captain , whose name was Floyd , with his brave men , went against the towns of Autossee and Tallisee , which lie on the banks of the river Tallapoosie.
<br>
<br>And Floyd went against them with boldness <span class="delstrike">,</span> and triumphed over them <span class="delstrike">,</span> and killed about two hundred of them , and burned their towns with fire , and slew the king of Autossee , and the king of Tallisee , who were the kings of two tribes.
<br>
<br>Moreover , on the thirteenth day of the next month , Claiborne , a governor , and a man of valor , went against the savages that dwelt on the river <span class="delstrike">Alabama ;</span> <span class="insert">Alabama.</span>
<br>
<br>And he marched with his army through the wilderness more than an hundred miles , to a town built upon a place called by the savages the Holy-Ground , where three of the Indian prophets dwelt.
<br>
<br>Now there were lying prophets among the savages , even as there were in the days of old <span class="insert">, among the children of Israel</span> ; and they prophesied according to their own wishes ;
<br>
<br>And those of shallow understanding believed them , and were led into a snare , whereby their whole tribe was nigh being destroyed.
<br>
<br>And Wetherford , the chief warrior of the Creek nation , was there also with his band.
<br>
<br>And he fought hard against Claiborne ; but he was overthrown , and fled , and the town was burnt , even two hundred houses.
<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>After</span> <span class="insert"><br>Notwithstanding</span> all these tribulations , the depredations of the savages of the south were not stayed.
<br>
<br>So Jackson , the chief captain , went out against them with his army , and attacked them at their strong hold <span class="insert">,</span> on the waters of the Tallapoosie , where they were entrenched , <span class="delstrike">having</span> <span class="insert">with</span> more than a thousand warriors.
<br>
<br>Now this was on the twenty and seventh day of the third month , in the one thousand eight hundred and fourteenth year of the <span class="delstrike">age of Christianity.</span> <span class="insert">Christian era.</span>
<br>
<br>And Jackson set his destroying engines to work , and fought desperately against them , for about the space of five hours ; when he overcame them , so that only <span class="insert">,</span> about a score escaped.
<br>
<br>Seven hundred and fifty of the savage warriors were found slain in battle ; and two hundred two score and ten women and children became captives to the army of Columbia.
<br>
<br>Manahoee <span class="delstrike">,</span> their chief prophet , was smitten in the mouth <span class="delstrike">,</span> and slain , and two other false prophets were slain with him.
<br>
<br>Moreover , about the first day of the sixth month , a brave man , whose name was Pearson , with the husbandmen of the states of North and South Carolina , went against them along the borders of the Alabama , and captured about six hundred of them.
<br>
<br>Thus did the men of Columbia triumph over them , and conquer them , even to the seventh time.
<br>
<br>And so the judgment of the Lord fell upon them for their unrighteousness , and for their wicked and murderous deeds.
<br>
<br>After which they repented of their evil , having , through their own folly , lost many thousand warriors.
<br>
<br>And <span class="delstrike">the</span> <span class="insert">their</span> chief warriors gave up their instruments of destruction , and laid them at the feet of Jackson , the chief captain.
<br>
<br>Even <span class="delstrike">Wetherford</span> <span class="insert">Wetberford</span> , the chief warrior , gave himself up to Jackson , saying , I fought with my might ; but I have brought evil upon my nation ; and thou hast slain my warriors ; and I <span class="delstrike">am overcome.</span> <span class="insert">myself am overcome</span>
<br>
<br>Now the savages are easily inflamed and roused to works of sin and death ; and of their weakness the servants of the king are not ashamed to take advantage ; even to the ruin of the poor and ignorant barbarians.
<br>
<br>So the warriors and the whole nation of the Creeks , being tired of a destructive war , entreated the men of Columbia for peace , saying unto Jackson ,
<br>
<br>Lo ! now are our eyes opened to our own profit ; now will we make peace with you.
<br>
<br>And if ye will no more suffer the fire , and the sword , and the destroying engines to spread desolation amongst us ,
<br>
<br>Then will we make a covenant with you , and give you for an inheritance a great part of the land which our fathers inherited before us.
<br>
<br>And the length and the breadth thereof shall be about as large as the whole island of Britain , whose men of war have led us into this snare.
<br>
<br>For although the king , who calleth himself our father , across the great waters , did put the instruments of death into our hands , and give us the black dust in abundance ; nevertheless <span class="insert">,</span> he deceived us ; and in the hour of danger his servants left us to take care of ourselves.
<br>
<br>So Jackson made a covenant with them <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> and it was signed by the chiefs of their nation.
<br>
<br>And after it had been examined by the wise men and the great Sanhedrim of the people , it was <span class="insert">ratified and</span> signed with the hand-writing of James , the chief governor of the land of Columbia.

<br>
<br>Continuation of the War with the Creeks--Gen. Jackson's <span class="insert">great</span> victory over them--they sue for peace--a treaty is concluded with them.
<br>
<br>NOTWITHSTANDING their discomfiture , the nation of the Creeks were still bent on warring against the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>2 And they committed many outrages upon the inhabitants of the states round about.
<br>
<br>3 But it came to pass , on the seventh day of the same month , that a messenger came to Jackson , the chief captain , and spake unto him , saying :
<br>
<br>4 Lo ! even now , more than a thousand savages have pitched their tents at Talledoga , near the strong hold of Lashley , with intent to assail it.
<br>
<br>5 Immediately Jackson took two thousand hardy men , who were called volunteers , because they <span class="insert">had , unsolicited , offered their services to their country ,</span> and led them against the savages.
<br>
<br>6 Now the men of war that followed after him were mostly from the state of Tennessee , and men of dauntless courage.
<br>
<br>7 So , early in the morning of the next day , the army of Jackson drew nigh the place , in battle array.
<br>
<br>8 And the savages came out towards the army of Columbia , with shouting and yellings : and again the engines of destruction were used plentifully.
<br>
<br>9 And the leaden balls whizzed about their ears like unto a nest of hornets.
<br>
<br>10 But the horsemen , and the whole army of Jackson , rushed upon the savages , and slew them with great slaughter , and overcame them.
<br>
<br>11 And the number of savages slain that day was about three hundred ; and a red-cross banner of the Spanish nation was found amongst them <span class="insert">,</span> and taken.
<br>
<br>12 Seventeen of the men of Columbia were slain and about four score wounded.
<br>
<br>13 So , when the battle was over , Jackson returned to his own camp.
<br>
<br>14 After these things had come to pass , on the twelfth day of the month , a certain captain , whose <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was White , was sent against another place called the Hillabee-Towns.
<br>
<br>15 And , on the eighteenth day of the same month , he took the towns , and destroyed them , and slew three score of the savages , and made about two hundred two score and ten prisoners.
<br>
<br>16 About eleven days afterwards , a valiant captain , whose name was Floyd , with his brave men , went against the towns of Autossee and Tallisee , which lie on the banks of the river Tallapoosie.
<br>
<br>17 And Floyd went against them with boldness and triumphed over them and killed about two hundred of them , and burned their towns with fire , and slew the king of Autossee , and the king of Tallisee , who were the kings of two tribes.

<br>
<br>19 And he marched with his army through the wilderness more than an hundred miles , to a town built upon a place called by the savages the Holy-Ground , where three of the Indian prophets dwelt.

<br>Plan of attack on Montreal defeated.
<br>
<br>THE frailty of man speaketh volumes <span class="delete">:</span> one man accuseth another ; but where is he who is perfect ?
<br>
<br>2 Man deviseth mighty plans in his own mind , but he accomplisheth them not.
<br>
<br>3 He is wise in his own conceit , but his wisdom faileth him : he seeth folly in others , but perceiveth not his own ; he is as a reed shaken with the wind.
<br>
<br>4 Now the country of Columbia was assailed on every side by the enemies of freedom.
<br>
<br>5 And in the hope that the war might speedily cease , and an end be made of the shedding of blood , the great Sanhedrim of the people wished to push their armies into the heart of the provinces of the king , even to Montreal.
<br>
<br>6 So they pitched upon certain chief captains , who were well skilled in the arts of warfare <span class="delete">;</span> and Wilkinson and Hampton were the names of the captains ;
<br>
<br>7 And Brown , and Boyd , and Covington , and Swift , and Coles , and Purdy , and Ripley , and Swartwout , and Fraser , and many others , were valiant captains under them.
<br>
<br>8 Not many days after Harrison returned from his triumph over Proctor's army ; and in the same year , it came to pass that Wilkinson conveyed his army from Fort George and the country of Niagara , to Sackett's Harbor , at the east end of lake Ontario ; leaving Harrison and M'Clure behind , at the strong hold of Fort George.
<br>
<br>9 From Sackett's Harbor Wilkinson moved to a place called Grenadier Island ; and in the first week of the eleventh month he arrived at Ogdensburgh , in order to go against the strong hold of Montreal.
<br>
<br>10 Now the army of Hampton rested nigh unto lake Champlain ; and about the same time he moved towards the borders of the king.
<br>
<br>11 And Wilkinson sent a messenger to him and entreated him to come and meet him , and join the two armies <span class="delete">together</span> at the village of St. Regis.
<br>
<br>12 The same night Wilkinson with his army crossed the great river St. Lawrence , near by the strong hold of Prescot , which lieth in the dominions of the king.
<br>
<br>13 And he moved down with about six thousand men towards the hold of Montreal , until he came to a place called Crystler's Farms , <span class="delete">near</span> unto Williamsburgh.
<br>
<br>14 Now at this place , on the eleventh day of the eleventh month , a strong band of the men of war of Britain , from Kingston and round about , fell upon his army in the rear , and annoyed them greatly.
<br>
<br>15 At length , on the same day , a part of the army of Columbia turned about , and fought against them and drove them back ; however it was a sore fight.
<br>
<br>16 Wilkinson , the chief captain who went before the host of Columbia , had been sick many days , and was unable to go forth against them himself.
<br>
<br>17 So he sent some of his brave captains , even Boyd , and Swartwout , and Covington ; and the engines of destruction were set to work with great noise and fury ; and the valiant Covington was wounded unto death.
<br>
<br>18 Moreover , the loss of the men of Columbia that day was an hundred slain , and two hundred two score and ten wounded , and the loss of the king was about an hundred four score and one.
<br>
<br>19 After this battle the army of Wilkinson moved along <span class="delete">down</span> the St. Lawrence until they came to <span class="delete">Barnhearts ,</span> near Cornwall , where they met the valiant Brown.
<br>
<br>20 Now this place lieth on the north side of the river , and on the other side lieth St. Regis , where Wilkinson , the chief captain , expected to be joined by the army of Hampton from Champlain.
<br>
<br>21 But in this he was disappointed ; for , lo ! Hampton sent one of his captains , whose name was Atkinson , to Wilkinson , with the tidings that he had declined to meet him , and was returning to his camp on the lake.
<br>
<br>22 Now when the army of Wilkinson heard those things , they were discouraged ; and all the plans that <span class="delete">were well</span> devised by Armstrong ,* the chief captain , and scribe of the great Sanhedrim , were of no avail.
<br>
<br>* Gen. Armstrong , Secretary at War.
<br>
<br>23 So the army of Wilkinson crossed the river again and came into the land of Columbia , at French Mills , near St. Regis ; where they went into winter quarters.
<br>
<br>24 And the men of Columbia , even the great Sanhedrim , were disappointed in their expectations.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , Hampton received much blame in the thing ; and he was even taxed with the crime of drinking too freely of the strong waters.
<br>
<br>26 But the imaginary evils which the children of men commit are oftentimes graven in brass , whilst their actual good deeds are written in sand.
<br>
<br>27 Neither shall it be forgotten here , that when the shivering soldiers of Columbia were suffering with cold in the north ,
<br>
<br>28 The lovely and patriotic daughters of Columbia , blest with tenderness , remembered them , and sent them coverings for their hands and <span class="delete">for their feet ,</span>
<br>
<br>29 Even from the fleece <span class="delete">:</span> of their fathers' flocks , they wrought them with their own hands , and distributed them with a good heart.
<br>
<br>30 And , for their kindness and humanity , the poor soldier blessed them , and their virtues were extolled by the men of Columbia throughout the land.

<br>22 Now when the army of Wilkinson heard those things , they were discouraged ; and all the plans that <span class="insert">had been</span> devised by Armstrong ,* the chief captain , and scribe of the great Sanhedrim , were of no avail.
<br>
<br>* Gen. Armstrong , Secretary at War.
<br>
<br>23 So the army of Wilkinson crossed the river again and came into the land of Columbia , at French Mills , near St. Regis ; where they went into winter quarters.
<br>
<br>24 And the men of Columbia , even the great Sanhedrim , were disappointed in their expectations.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , Hampton received much blame in the thing ; and he was even taxed with the crime of drinking too freely of the strong waters.
<br>
<br>26 But the imaginary evils which the children of men commit are oftentimes graven in brass , whilst their actual good deeds are written in sand.
<br>
<br>27 Neither shall it be forgotten here , that <span class="insert">,</span> when the shivering soldiers of Columbia were suffering with cold in the north ,
<br>
<br>28 The lovely and patriotic daughters of Columbia , blest with tenderness , remembered them , and sent them coverings for their hands and <span class="insert">their feet :</span>
<br>
<br>29 Even from the fleece of their fathers' flocks , they wrought them with their own hands , and distributed them with a good heart.
<br>
<br>30 And , for their kindness and humanity , the poor soldier blessed them , and their virtues were extolled by the men of Columbia throughout the land.

<br>4 So McClure , the chief captain of the fort , called a council of his officers , and they agreed to depart to the strong hold of Niagara.

<br>
<br>6 Likewise they put a lighted match to the black dust <span class="delete">,</span> in the fort , and it was rent asunder with a great noise , as it were of thunder and an earthquake.

<br>7 Moreover , they burnt the town of Newark , before they departed , which happened on the tenth day of the twelfth month.

<br>8 Howbeit , they gave the inhabitants time to <span class="delete">flee</span> before they put the burning torch to their dwellings ; nevertheless , it was an evil thing , and pleased not the people of Columbia.

<br>11 And they fell <span class="delete">upon them unawares</span> , while they were yet asleep in their tents ; and overcame them , and took the fort , and put the garrison to the sword ; even the women and children suffered under the savage tomahawk.

<br>12 Now the people of Columbia , who were massacred that day , were about two hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>13 But the captain of the hold , whose name was Leonard , was charged with the evil ; for he had left the fort , and neglected that duty which should ever be the pride of a soldier.
<br>
<br>14 Nevertheless , when they had committed all this horrid slaughter , the barbarians were not fully glutted with murder ;
<br>
<br>15 So they went against the little villages of Lewistown , Manchester , Youngstown , and Tuscarora , and burnt them with fire , and slew the poor and helpless that dwelt round about the place.

<br>Cruise of the U. S. frigate Essex , D. Porter commander--Her defence and capture , at Valparaiso.
<br>
<br>NOW <span class="delete">while</span> the great lakes and rivers were bound in fetters of ice , and the <span class="delete">armies</span> of Columbia slumbered in the winter camps of the north ;
<br>
<br>2 And whilst the conquering sword of Jackson spread ruin and desolation among the misguided savages of the south ;
<br>
<br>3 Lo ! new scenes of warfare appeared upon the waters of the great deep.
<br>
<br>4 In the first year of the war David , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Porter , sailed from the shores of Columbia towards the south , that he might capture the vessels of the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>5 And the ship which he commanded was one of the strong vessels of Columbia , called the Essex.
<br>
<br>6 Now David was a valiant man , and he had contrived a plan to annoy the commerce of Britain in the waters of the great Pacific Ocean.
<br>
<br>7 So , in process of time , he passed around the furthermost part of the land of Columbia , which is called Cape Horn , and lieth far to the south ; near the country of Patagonia , which is inhabited by the barbarians , and sailed towards the haven of Valparaiso.
<br>
<br>8 From whence , leaving Chili to the south , he moved along the coast of Peru , till he came to Lima , where it never rains :
<br>
<br>9 A country where gold and silver are found in abundance , and where there is one continual summer , and the trees blossom throughout the year.
<br>
<br>10 Again , he prepared his vessels , and sailed from Lima towards the north , until he fell upon the islands of Gallapagos ; called the enchanted islands.
<br>
<br>11 Now these islands lie upon the west side of the great continent of Columbia , under a meridian sun , beneath the girdle of the world.
<br>
<br>12 Hereabouts he captured a multitude of the merchant ships of Britain , laden with rich merchandize , and silver and gold.
<br>
<br>13 And he fixed a score of the destroying engines into one of the ships he had taken ; and made her a fighting vessel , and called her name Essex Junior , and a man , whose name was Downs , he made captain thereof.
<br>
<br>14 And he fell upon the fishermen of Britain , and captured those who went out to catch the mighty whales , which afford oil to give us light in the night time , and <span class="delete">the bones thereof</span> shade our daughters from the scorching sun of the noon-day.
<br>
<br>15 Moreover , David went to an island where <span class="delete">there</span> dwelt wild savages , and established himself so that he could go out and return whensoever he chose.
<br>
<br>16 And when he departed from the island , which he called after the chief governor of the land of Columbia in those days ,* he left some of his men , with the weapons of war <span class="delete">,</span> to defend the place.
<br>
<br>* Madison Island.
<br>
<br>17 Now David was a grievous thorn in the side of Britain , and he almost destroyed her commerce in the South Seas :
<br>
<br>18 Inasmuch as he put the wise men of the king to their wits end ; for they were unable to out-sail him and take him captive.
<br>
<br>19 So they sent their strong ships in search of him , by two's , over the whole face of the waters of the Southern Ocean ; and the expense thereof would have made more than two feasts for the Prince Regent , who governed England in the name of his father.
<br>
<br>20 However , it came to pass , that David returned again in his ship to the haven of Valparaiso ; and the vessel , called the Essex Junior , accompanied him.
<br>
<br>21 Now Downs , who commanded her , had been to the place before , and conducted the prizes of David there , and brought him the tidings that he was likely to be ensnared upon the waters.
<br>
<br>22 So whilst David was there , on the twenty-eighth day of the third month , in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year of the Christian era ,
<br>
<br>23 He looked around , and behold ! he saw two of the strong ships of Britain approaching , for the purpose of hemming him in ; the one called the Phoebe , and the other the Cherub.
<br>
<br>24 But his heart sank not within him , for he knew no cowardice ; but , with the wisdom of a brave man , he strove to escape , as the vessels were too powerful for him.
<br>
<br>25 But the winds were adverse , and blew <span class="delete">back</span> , and prevented the tacklings of his ship from taking effect :
<br>
<br>26 Nevertheless , David said unto the captains of the king , Come singly , and not like cowards , upon me ; then shall ye receive the thunders of the freemen of Columbia abundantly ;
<br>
<br>27 And her <span class="delete">liberty</span> shall not suffer , although in the contest ye may destroy my vessel upon the face of the waters.
<br>
<br>28 But <span class="delete">Hillyar ,</span> the captain of the king's ship called the Phoebe , was afraid lest he should be overcome.
<br>
<br>29 Now , when David found he was unable to make good his escape , he drew nigh the land , that he might be protected by the great law of nations ; for it was a place friendly to both parties.
<br>
<br>30 But in this he was deceived ; for the authorities of Spain trembled at the nod of the servants of Britain , in whom there was no faith.
<br>
<br>31 So both vessels came upon him , like ravenous wolves , in the very haven of Valparaiso ; thus transgressing the law of nations , and committing an outrage which hath few examples under the sun.
<br>
<br>32 And they set their engines to work upon the Essex with all their might.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , David fought against them with desperation , for there was no hope left for him to escape ; neither did he expect mercy.
<br>
<br>34 And he held out for more than the space of two hours , when he became overpowered ; having his ship a sinking wreck , covered with blood , and on fire ; with about an hundred and fifty of his men slain and
<span class="delete"><br>maimed.</span>
<br>
<br>35 So after David had fought hard , he became captive to the ships of the king ; who had also some of their men slain , and some wounded.
<br>
<br>36 Moreover , Hillyar gave him praise and called him a man of courage ; for he fought against two strong ships of Britain.
<br>
<br>37 And David made a covenant with Hillyar , in which the Essex Junior was given unto him and his men , that they might return in her again to their own country.
<br>
<br>38 And it came to pass , in the seventh month of the same year of the battle , David arrived in the city of New-York ; having been absent about two years.
<br>
<br>39 Now when the people of Columbia beheld the valiant Porter , they were rejoiced with exceeding great joy ; inasmuch as they <span class="delete">untackled</span> the horses from before his chariot , and drew him through the city.
<br>
<br>40 And they made a sumptuous feast for him , and invited a multitude of guests ; and spent the day in gladness and mirth.

<br>22 So <span class="insert">,</span> whilst David was there , on the twenty-eighth day of the third month , in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year of the Christian era ,
<br>
<br>23 He looked around , and behold ! he saw two of the strong ships of Britain approaching , for the purpose of hemming him in ; the one called the Phoebe , and the other the Cherub.
<br>
<br>24 But his heart sank not within him , for he knew no cowardice ; but , with the wisdom of a brave man , he strove to escape , as the vessels were too powerful for him.
<br>
<br>25 But the winds were adverse , and blew <span class="insert">hard</span> , and prevented the tacklings of his ship from taking effect :
<br>
<br>26 Nevertheless , David said unto the captains of the king , Come singly , and not like cowards , upon me ; then shall ye receive the thunders of the freemen of Columbia abundantly ;
<br>
<br>27 And her <span class="insert">fame</span> shall not suffer , although in the contest ye may destroy my vessel upon the face of the waters.
<br>
<br>28 But <span class="insert">Hillyar,</span> the captain of the king's ship called the Phoebe , was afraid lest he should be overcome.
<br>
<br>29 Now , when David found he was unable to make good his escape , he drew nigh the land , that he might be protected by the great law of nations ; for it was a place friendly to both parties.
<br>
<br>30 But in this he was deceived ; for the authorities of Spain trembled at the nod of the servants of Britain , in whom there was no faith.
<br>
<br>31 So both vessels came upon him , like ravenous wolves , in the very haven of Valparaiso ; thus transgressing the law of nations , and committing an outrage which hath few examples under the sun.
<br>
<br>32 And they set their engines to work upon the Essex with all their might.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , David fought against them with desperation , for there was no hope left for him to escape ; neither did he expect mercy.
<br>
<br>34 And he held out for more than the space of two hours , when he became overpowered ; having his ship a sinking wreck , covered with blood , and on fire ; with about an hundred and fifty of his men slain and <span class="insert">maimed :</span>
<br>
<br>35 So <span class="insert">,</span> after David had fought hard , he became captive to the ships of the king ; who had also some of their men slain , and some wounded.
<br>
<br>36 Moreover , Hillyar gave him praise and called him a man of courage ; for he fought against two strong ships of Britain.
<br>
<br>37 And David made a covenant with Hillyar , in which the Essex Junior was given unto him and his men , that they might return in her again to their own country.
<br>
<br>38 And it came to pass , in the seventh month of the same year of the battle , David arrived in the city of New-York ; having been absent about two years.
<br>
<br>39 Now when the people of Columbia beheld the valiant Porter , they were rejoiced with exceeding great joy ; inasmuch as they <span class="insert">unharnessed</span> the horses from before his chariot , and drew him through the city.
<br>
<br>40 And they made a sumptuous feast for him , and invited a multitude of guests ; and spent the day in gladness and mirth.

<br>
<br>2 Being upon the waters of the great deep , fell in with a small vessel of the United States , called the Frolic , and made capture thereof.
<br>
<br>3 However , in the same month , not many days afterwards , a fighting vessel of Columbia , called the Peacock , commanded by the brave Warrington , met one of the vessels of the king.
<br>
<br>4 Now they were about equal in force ; and the name of the vessel of Britain was called L'Epervier <span class="delete">,</span> and the captain's name was Wales.
<br>
<br>5 And they sat the engines of destruction to work , and fought with great fury for the space of forty <span class="delete">minutes ;</span>
<br>
<br>6 When the mariners of Columbia overcame the servants of the king , and the vessel of Britain struck her red-cross to the ship of Warrington.
<br>
<br>7 And there were slain and wounded of the servants of the king about twenty and three ; but there were none slain of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>8 Moreover , Warrington gat about an hundred and twenty thousand pieces of silver , that were in the vessel.
<br>
<br>9 And he received great praise throughout the land for this gallant exploit.
<br>
<br>10 And the great Sanhedrim thanked him and gave him a medal of gold.
<br>
<br>11 Likewise , the people of Savannah , a chief town in the state of Georgia , being a thousand miles to the south of New-York , honored him greatly.

<br>
<br>15 And a dreadful battle began ; and the mischievous <span class="delete">weapons</span> of destruction showered around with tremendous noise.
<br>
<br>16 Nevertheless , <span class="delete">Blakeley</span> ran down upon the Reindeer , and in about twenty minutes <span class="delete">made her a captive unto the ship of Columbia.</span>
<br>
<br>17 But her captain was slain , and she was as it were a wreck upon the waters ; so <span class="delete">Blakeley</span> destroyed her.
<br>
<br>18 The loss of the king , in killed and wounded that day , was about seventy and five ; and five of the <span class="delete">children</span> of Columbia were slain , and about a score <span class="delete">maimed</span>
<br>
<br>19 And the friends of the great Sanhedrim were pleased with the valiant acts of <span class="delete">Blakeley.</span>

<br>20 Moreover , on the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month , the Wasp captured another ship of the king , called the Avon , and sunk her to the bottom of the <span class="delete">briny</span> deep.
<br>
<br>21 And the slain and <span class="delete">the</span> wounded of the Avon , was two score and two.

<br>22 Howbeit <span class="delete">,</span> about the same time , the Syren and the Rattlesnake* fell into the hands of the king.

<br>
<br>23 About this time the whole land of Columbia was ordered to be hemmed in by Cochrane , a servant of the king , and a chief captain of the navy of Britain.
<br>
<br>24 But all their blockades were of no avail ; for the men of Columbia escaped and outwitted them.

<br>
<br>NOW it came to pass , in the second month of the same year in which David gat home to the United States ,
<br>
<br>2 That the armies of the north began to be in motion , and departed from the place called French Mills , where they were encamped.
<br>
<br>3 And a part thereof moved towards Plattsburgh , on lake Champlain ; and was commanded by a brave man , whose name was Macomb , and Wilkinson , the chief captain , followed after them.
<br>
<br>4 But the other part of the host , commanded by Jacob , whose <span class="delete">sur-name was Brown</span> went to Sackett's Harbor ; and from thence against the strong hold of Niagara.
<br>
<br>5 And it was so , that when Wilkinson heard that Jacob had gone against Niagara ; he marshalled out his force , and went against a place in the province of the king , called La-Cole-Mill , to take it.
<br>
<br>6 Nevertheless , he failed , and lost many men <span class="delete">,</span> after which the command of the army was given to a chief captain , whose name was <span class="delete">Izard ,</span>
<br>
<br>7 In the meanwhile many of the evils of warfare were committed on and about the waters of Ontario and the great lake Erie.

<br>11 And the next day <span class="delete">,</span> being the anniversary of the independence of Columbia , after having left some of the men of war to defend the place ,
<br>
<br>12 He moved with his host towards the plains of Chippawa , where they rested for the night.

<br>13 On the next day Jacob assembled his captains of fifties , and his captains of hundreds , and spake unto them , saying ,
<br>
<br>14 Lo ! the army of the king are mighty men of valor , and their numbers are great , even those who <span class="delete">have fought</span> under the banners of <span class="delete">Wellington.*</span> the chief warrior of Britain ; and Riall , the chief captain of the host , is a man of great experience :
<br>
<br>* Lord Wellington.
<br>
<br>15 Nevertheless , be not disheartened ; but let us beware that we be not ensnared.
<br>
<br>16 So he prepared his army to go against the host of Britain , in battle array ; and the soldiers of Columbia shouted for the battle.
<br>
<br>17 Now the army of Britain rested upon the plains of Chippawa , and were ready to meet the army of Columbia ; they shouted aloud , and inflamed their blood with the strong waters of Jamaica.
<br>
<br>18 And they put fire to the black dust of the destroying engines ; and a great noise issued from the mouths thereof.
<br>
<br>19 Moreover , they vomited fire and smoke and brimstone <span class="delete">wonderfully</span> , and with the movements of the armies the dust of the earth arose and overshadowed the field of slaughter.
<br>
<br>20 And the heavy balls of iron whistled about them in abundance.
<br>
<br>21 However , the skill of Jacob , and his brave captains , became manifest , and they drove the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain before them ,
<br>
<br>22 And compelled them to flee to their strong entrenchments at Fort George and Fort Niagara.
<br>
<br>23 And the field of battle was covered with the slain and the maimed ; even eight hundred men.
<br>
<br>24 And the slain and wounded of the servants of the king were about five hundred.

<br>
<br>11 And the next day being the anniversary of the independence of Columbia , after having left some of the men of war to defend the place ,
<br>
<br>12 He moved with his host towards the plains of Chippawa , where they rested for the night.
<br>
<br>13 On the next day Jacob assembled his captains of fifties , and his captains of hundreds , and spake unto them , saying ,
<br>
<br>14 Lo ! the army of the king are mighty men of valor , and their numbers are great , even those who <span class="insert">fought in Spain ,</span> under the banners of <span class="insert">Wellington ,*</span> the chief warrior of Britain ; and Riall , the chief captain of the host , is a man of great experience :
<br>
<br>* Lord Wellington.
<br>
<br>15 Nevertheless , be not disheartened ; but let us beware that we be not ensnared.
<br>
<br>16 So he prepared his army to go against the host of Britain , in battle array ; and the soldiers of Columbia shouted for the battle.
<br>
<br>17 Now the army of Britain rested upon the plains of Chippawa , and were ready to meet the army of Columbia ; they shouted aloud , and inflamed their blood with the strong waters of Jamaica.
<br>
<br>18 And they put fire to the black dust of the destroying engines ; and a great noise issued from the mouths thereof.
<br>
<br>19 Moreover , they vomited fire and smoke and brimstone <span class="insert">incessantly</span> , and with the movements of the armies the dust of the earth arose and overshadowed the field of slaughter.
<br>
<br>20 And the heavy balls of iron whistled about them in abundance.
<br>
<br>21 However , the skill of Jacob , and his brave captains , became manifest , and they drove the <span class="insert">host</span> of Britain before them ,
<br>
<br>22 And compelled them to flee to their strong entrenchments at Fort George and Fort Niagara.
<br>
<br>23 And the field of battle was covered with the slain and the maimed ; even eight hundred men.
<br>
<br>24 And the slain and wounded of the servants of the king were about five hundred.
<br>
<br>25 So Jacob and his army gat great praise , and all the warriors of Columbia that fought that day <span class="insert">:</span>
<br>
<br>26 Amongst whom were the volunteers of the states of New-York and Pennsylvania <span class="insert">,</span> who were led on by the gallant Porter.*
<br>
<br>* Gens. Porter , Ripley , and Scott.
<br>
<br>27 And Ripley was there , and the brave Scott , who went out and fought in the heat of the battle.

<br>
<br>17 The loss of the men of Columbia was also very great ; being an hundred three score and ten slain , and more than five hundred maimed.

<br>
<br>4 Moreover , they threw up breast-works and prepared their battering-rams , with intent to destroy the place , and make captives of the men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>5 <span class="delete">For as the invincible soldiers of Britain had lost a great deal of honor ; they longed to gain some favor in the sight of the king , their master ; so they sat their bombs and their engines at the work of destruction.

<br>6</span> And on the fifteenth day of the month , after they had prepared themselves , they rushed forth with all their might against the strong hold of Columbia.

<span class="delete"><br>7</span> And as their deeds were evil , they began in the dead of the night , when the howlings of the <span class="delete">wild-wolf</span> are heard from afar , and the steady roar of distant waterfalls , catches the ear of the drowsy centinel.

<span class="delete"><br>8</span> Lo ! it was a night dark and gloomy ; and the very clouds of heaven wept for the folly of man.*

<br>
<span class="delete"><br>14</span> Thus violating the commandment of God , which sayeth , Thou shalt do no murder.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>15</span> But the hand of the Lord was stretched out against him ; for while he was yet speaking , in the wickedness of his heart , he was smitten dead to the earth.

<span class="delete"><br>24</span> About this time Izard , the chief captain , arrived at Fort Erie , from Plattsburgh , and , as he was the oldest captain , he took the charge of the army of the north.

<span class="delete"><br>26</span> Moved his army towards Burlington Heights , and went more than an hundred miles into the province of Canada.

<br>Attack on Stonington , by the British ships of war <span class="delete">,</span> which are defeated and driven off.
<br>
<br>IN these days the strong powers of Britain strove hard to quench the fire of Columbian <span class="delete">Liberty.</span>
<br>
<br>2 But it was lighted up by the hand of heaven , and not to be <span class="delete">extinguished by the insignificant and self-created gods of the earth.</span>
<br>
<br>3 Now it came to pass , on the ninth day of the eighth month of the same year ,
<br>
<br>4 That the mighty ships of Britain came and opened their thundering engines upon the little town of Stonington , which lieth in the state of Connecticut , in the east.
<br>
<br>5 But the inhabitants of the place were bold and valiant men , and they scorned to make a covenant with the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>6 Although Hardy ,* the chief captain of the king's ships <span class="delete">,</span> had threatened to destroy the place ; saying , Remove from the town your women and your children , who are innocent and fight not.

<br>
<br>9 Notwithstanding , they had but two of the destroying engines in the place.
<br>
<br>10 However , on the eleventh day of the same month , they were again forced to put them in motion.
<br>
<br>11 For , in the <span class="delete">mean time</span> , Hardy had sent a messenger to the inhabitants , saying ,
<br>
<br>12 If ye will not prove wicked , and will refrain from sending your evil torpedoes amongst our vessels , then will we spare your town.
<br>
<br>13 Now Hardy was mightily afraid of these torpedoes , (the history whereof is written in the fiftieth book of these chronicles) and he trembled at the sound of the name thereof.
<br>
<br>14 Nevertheless , the people of Stonington refused his request.
<br>
<br>15 So the ships of Britain came again and they brought another strong ship of the king to help them to take the place.
<br>
<br>16 But once more the valiant sons of Connecticut made them fly for safety : and they came not again.

<br>15 And the army of Columbia that went out to meet the host of Britain , was commanded by a brave man , whose name was Winder.

<br>16 But it was in the heat of summer , and the husbandmen of Columbia , that went out to defend the place , were weary , for they had travelled many miles from the house of their fathers.

<span class="delete"><br>Capture of</span> Washington--Sacking of Alexandria--death of Sir Peter Parker.
<br>
<br>NOW , when Ross , the chief captain , had done speaking , they sent forth their <span class="delete">fire-brands</span> , and sat their destroying engines to work , and cast balls of destruction and death.
<br>
<br>2 Nevertheless , the men of Columbia were not dismayed , but poured out their thunders upon them in abundance.
<br>
<br>3 And Joshua , <span class="delete">sur-named</span> Barney , who commanded the vessels of Columbia <span class="delete">nigh</span> the place , with his brave men , went out upon the land , and fought against them with desperation.
<br>
<br>4 For he had ordered his little fleet to be burnt with fire , that the men of Britain might not profit thereby , and it blew up in the air with a loud noise.
<br>
<br>5 Now Joshua was in the heat of the battle and his destroying engines slew the men of Britain on all sides : however , he was wounded and made captive.
<br>
<br>6 But the servants of the king treated Joshua well , and <span class="delete">honored</span> him for his bravery.
<br>
<br>7 Now James , the chief governor , and the <span class="delete">counsellors</span> , and the scribes of the great Sanhedrim , went out to see the battle , and to contrive for the safety of the city.
<br>
<br>8 And <span class="delete">Monroe</span> ,* the chief scribe of the great Sanhedrim , was there ; and Armstrong ,** and many other friends of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>* Hon. James <span class="delete">Monroe ,</span> Sec'ry of State.
<br>
<br>** Gen. Armstrong.
<br>
<br>9 Nevertheless , the wisdom of all their plans failed them ; and they were sorely grieved to behold the husbandmen and the army of Winder , the chief captain , flee before the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>10 But they were misled in their calculations ; and they were now unable to prevent the evil.
<br>
<br>11 Neither did the men of war they counted upon arrive in time to catch the army of the king.
<br>
<br>12 Therefore , the host of Columbia fled , and went beyond the city , and passing through Georgetown , rested at a place called Montgomery Court-house.
<br>
<br>13 And the slain and maimed of the king , were about four hundred : those of the men of Columbia about two score.
<br>
<br>14 Now it was about the going down of the sun , when the host of the king polluted the Citadel of Freedom , and with their unhallowed footsteps violated the Temple of Liberty.
<br>
<br>15 And Cockburn and Ross led the savage band of Britain into the midst of the city.
<br>
<br>16 And the men of Columbia gnashed their <span class="delete">teeth</span> , and bit their lips with vexation ; for the thing might have been prevented.*
<br>
<br>* Whatever may be individual sentiment , it has been , and still is the <span class="delete">general</span> opinion of the best informed , that there was sufficient time to have had the place entrenched and fortified , if necessary , with an hundred pieces of cannon ; and at least to have kept the enemy at bay until a sufficient force were assembled to have cut off his retreat. But to expect raw militia to meet and repulse , in an open plain , solid columns of regular troops , superior in numbers as well as discipline , must be preposterous. Who is to blame in the business we presume not to say ; but hope the evil may be <span class="delete">remedied against a future day.</span> Had the same energy and industry been exercised <span class="delete">there</span> , that were displayed by the patriotic citizens of New-York in erecting fortifications for the defence of their capital , we might have been spared the mortification that followed the capture of the seat of government.
<br>
<br>17 Nevertheless , it proved a blessing <span class="delete">,</span> for it united the people of Columbia as one man , against the tyrants of the earth.
<br>
<br>18 Now the place that had been pitched upon to build the chief city , was in a fine country , and a beautiful spot , in the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>19 But the inhabitants round about the City of Washington were few ; for they had , as it were , just <span class="delete">begun</span> to build it.
<br>
<br>20 There was much ground laid out for the city , <span class="delete">even six thousand four hundred square furlongs ;</span> but the buildings therein were not many ; neither was it fortified.
<br>
<br>21 So when the servants of the king came to the place , they looked around , in surprise , and cried out with astonishment , saying ,
<br>
<br>22 Lo ! the city hath fled with the people , for there are but an handful of houses in the place.
<br>
<br>23 However , the next day they began the work of destruction , like unto the barbarians of ancient times ; for their wickedness followed after them as the shadow followeth after the substance.
<br>
<br>24 And they destroyed the beautiful edifices with fire , even the palace of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<br>25 Now Cockburn <span class="delete">hated</span> that his wicked deeds should be handed down to future generations <span class="delete">, so he</span> went and destroyed , with his own hands , the chief printing-office* of the city , and scattered the types <span class="delete">abroad.</span>
<br>
<br>* Office of the National Intelligencer.
<br>
<br>26 Thus did he , even Cockburn , like an ignorant savage , stamp his own name with infamy , and make it <span class="delete">to</span> become a reproach amongst all mankind.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>27</span> Science and learning blushed at the champions of England , who had been represented as the bulwark of religion ; but who were , in reality , the supporters of idolatry ; the staff of Juggernaut , the false god of India.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> Now the art of printing was not known among the ancients ; for it was invented in these latter days , even in the fourteen hundred and fortieth year of the Christian era.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> It was the helpmate of Freedom , and when the light which it spread burst forth upon the world , it began to open the eyes of man , and to destroy the poisonous weeds that choaked the growth of Liberty.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>30</span> Moreover , to complete the vandalism of Cockburn and Ross , they fell upon the printed books of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>31</span> Even those that had been gathered together for instruction ; the toil of many years <span class="delete">,</span> containing the learning and wisdom of ages.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> And they consumed them with fire ; thus striving to turn man back to the ages of ignorance and <span class="delete">darkness.
<br>
<br>33</span> Now , Thomas , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Jefferson , who had been a scribe in the days of Washington , and a chief governor <span class="delete">of</span> the land of Columbia , in times past ; a man whom the people esteemed for his virtue <span class="delete">,
<br>
<br>34</span> When he heard of their wickedness ; how , savage-like , they had burnt the books which had been written by the wise men of the earth , and preserved from the beginning to that day ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>35</span> In the goodness of his heart , he wrote unto the great Sanhedrim , when they were assembled together , saying :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> Since , like the barbarians of old , whose ignorance might plead for them , the servants of the kingdom of Great Britain have laid waste your chief city , and made it a desolation ,
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>37</span> And have trampled upon science , mutilated the monuments of art and industry , destroyed the archives of your nation <span class="delete">,</span> and burnt your books with fire ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>38</span> For your benefit , and for the benefit of my country , I will give unto you my whole Library , which I have selected with care , from my youth upwards <span class="delete">,</span> and whatever in your judgment shall be the value thereof , that will I accept.*
<br>
<br>* Mr. Jefferson left it to Congress to make him what compensation they thought proper for his Library.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>39</span> I am well stricken in years , and must shortly sleep with my fathers ; but the last wish of my heart shall be the welfare of my country.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>40</span> Now Thomas was a Philosopher , and a man of great learning , and he had abundance of books of all nations , and in all languages , even ten thousand volumes.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>41</span> So the great Sanhedrim accepted the offer of Thomas , and they retain the books to this day.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>42</span> Now it came to pass , in the evening of the same day , on which the vandals of Britain set fire to the city , that the army of the king fled from the place ; for the air of Liberty <span class="delete">was</span> poison to the followers of tyrants.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>43</span> Moreover , they left some of their slain and wounded behind , for they were afraid of being caught in a snare by the husbandmen of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>44</span> So they went down to the river and gat into their vessels from whence they came.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>45</span> In the meantime , the inhabitants of Alexandria , a town which lieth to the south of the chief city , on the river <span class="delete">Potomac</span> , in the state of Virginia ,
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>46</span> Being smitten with fear , sent to Cockburn and Ross , entreating <span class="delete">mercy ,</span> that they might be spared , if , peradventure , they made a covenant in good faith with them , and surrendered themselves.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>47</span> And the chief captains of Britain agreed to the capitulation of the town , and to vouchsafe <span class="delete">it protection.
<br>
<br>48</span> But the people suffered for their foolish confidence ; and no one pitied them ; for it was of their own seeking.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>49</span> So it happened , after they had trusted to the faith of the servants of the king ; Gordon , a captain of the ships in the river Potomac , came up against them before the town ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>50</span> And took their merchant ships ; and compelled the people to open their store-houses , and put into the vessels their flour , even sixteen thousand barrels , and their wine <span class="delete">,</span> and their cotton , and a thousand hogsheads of the sweet-scented plant.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>51</span> So the robbers of the king took them away , sacked the town , and laughed at the people thereof , for trusting to the faith of British <span class="delete">honor.
<br>
<br>52</span> However , as they passed along down the river , with their ill-gotten treasure , lo ! the ships of Britain were assailed , and nigh being destroyed :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>53</span> For Rogers , and Perry , and Porter , three valiant captains of the navy of Columbia , gave them hindrance and annoyed them greatly :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>54</span> Perry and Porter raised fortifications upon the borders of the river , and put therein the destroying engines , which , when the vessels came nigh by , they let loose upon them abundantly , and wounded them in their tackling , and slew numbers of their men.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>55</span> Moreover , the balls which the engines vomited forth , were red and hot from the mouth of the fiery furnace.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>56</span> Meanwhile , Rogers sent his fire-ships among them to destroy them as they fled ; nevertheless they escaped.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>51</span> Now about this time , being the thirtieth day of the same month , Peter , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Parker , who commanded a strong ship of the king , was committing many depredations along the shores of the Chesapeake ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>58</span> So Peter essayed to go <span class="delete">in the nighttime against some</span> husbandmen of Columbia , commanded by the gallant Reid ,* about the borders of the state of Maryland ;
<br>
<br>* Col. <span class="delete">Reid.
<br>
<br>59</span> And when he had landed his men of war , he went out after the husbandmen , and the plunder ; but they were upon the watch , and fell upon him , and killed and maimed about two score , and <span class="delete">was</span> nigh making captives of them all ; and Peter was amongst the slain.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>60</span> Now when the news of the taking of the chief city of Columbia , and the sacking of Alexandria was received in Britain , at first the people rejoiced , saying , Now , forsooth , have we conquered these cunning Yankees !
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>61</span> But afterwards they became <span class="delete">, for once ,</span> ashamed , and hid their faces ; for they had heard the judgment of the surrounding nations , by whom their vandalism was <span class="delete">condemned.</span>

<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>Capture of</span> <span class="insert"><br>Attack on</span> Washington--Sacking of Alexandria--death of Sir Peter Parker.
<br>
<br>NOW , when Ross , the chief captain , had done speaking , they sent forth their <span class="delstrike">fire-brands</span> <span class="insert">fire brands</span> , and sat their destroying engines to work , and cast balls of destruction and death.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , the men of Columbia were not dismayed , but poured out their thunders upon them in abundance.
<br>
<br>And Joshua , <span class="delstrike">sur-named</span> <span class="insert">sir-named</span> Barney , who commanded the vessels of Columbia <span class="delstrike">nigh</span> <span class="insert">near</span> the place , with his brave men , went out upon the land , and fought against them with desperation.
<br>
<br>For he had ordered his little fleet to be burnt with fire , that the men of Britain might not profit thereby , and it blew up in the air with a loud noise.
<br>
<br>Now Joshua was in the heat of the battle <span class="insert">;</span> and his destroying engines slew the men of Britain on all sides : however , he was wounded and made captive.
<br>
<br>But <span class="insert">!</span> the servants of the king treated Joshua well , and <span class="delstrike">honored</span> <span class="insert">honoured</span> him for his bravery.
<br>
<br>Now James , the chief governor , and the <span class="delstrike">counsellors</span> <span class="insert">counselors</span> , and the scribes of the great Sanhedrim , went out to see the battle , and to contrive for the safety of the city.
<br>
<br>And <span class="delstrike">Monroe</span> <span class="insert">Munroe</span> ,* the chief scribe of the great Sanhedrim , was there ; and Armstrong ,** and many other friends of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>* Hon. James <span class="delstrike">Monroe ,</span> <span class="insert">Munroe , then</span> Sec'ry of State.
<br>
<br>** Gen. Armstrong.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , the wisdom of all their plans failed them ; and they were sorely grieved to behold the husbandmen and the army of Winder , the chief captain , flee before the host of Britain.
<br>
<br>But they were misled in their calculations ; and they were now unable to prevent the evil.
<br>
<br>Neither did the men of war they counted upon arrive in time to catch the army of the king.
<br>
<br>Therefore , the host of Columbia fled , and went beyond the city , and passing through Georgetown , rested at a place called Montgomery Court-house.
<br>
<br>And the slain and maimed of the king , were about four hundred : those of the men of Columbia about two score.
<br>
<br>Now it was about the going down of the sun , when the host of the king polluted the Citadel of Freedom , and with their unhallowed footsteps violated the Temple of Liberty.
<br>
<br>And Cockburn and Ross led the savage band of Britain into the midst of the city.
<br>
<br>And the men of Columbia gnashed their <span class="delstrike">teeth</span> <span class="insert">teeth.</span> , and bit their lips with vexation ; for the thing might have been prevented.*
<br>
<br>* Whatever may be individual sentiment , it has been , and still is the <span class="delstrike">general</span> opinion of the best informed , that there was sufficient time to have had the place entrenched and fortified , if necessary , with an hundred pieces of cannon ; and at least to have kept the enemy at bay <span class="insert">,</span> until a sufficient force were assembled to have cut off his retreat. But to expect raw militia to meet and repulse , in an open plain , solid columns of regular troops , superior in numbers as well as discipline , must be preposterous. Who is to blame in the business we presume not to say ; but hope <span class="insert">a recurrence of</span> the evil may be <span class="delstrike">remedied against a future day.</span> <span class="insert">provided against in future.</span> Had the same energy and industry been exercised <span class="delstrike">there</span> <span class="insert">at the city of Washington</span> , that were displayed by the patriotic citizens of New-York <span class="insert">,</span> in erecting fortifications for the defence of their capital , we might have been spared the mortification that followed the capture of the seat of government.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , it proved a blessing <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> for it united the people of Columbia as one man , against the tyrants of the earth.
<br>
<br>Now the place that had been pitched upon to build the chief city , was in a fine country , and a beautiful spot , in the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>But the inhabitants round about the City of Washington were few ; for they had , as it were , just <span class="delstrike">begun</span> <span class="insert">began</span> to build it.
<br>
<br>There was much ground laid out for the city , <span class="delstrike">even six thousand four hundred square furlongs ;</span> but the buildings therein were not many ; neither was it fortified.
<br>
<br>So when the servants of the king came to the place , they looked around , in surprise , and cried out with astonishment , saying ,
<br>
<br>Lo ! the city hath fled with the people , for there are but an handful of houses in the place.
<br>
<br>However , the next day they began the work of destruction , like unto the barbarians of ancient times ; for their wickedness followed after them as the shadow followeth after the substance.
<br>
<br>And they destroyed the beautiful edifices with fire , even the palace of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<br>Now Cockburn <span class="delstrike">hated</span> <span class="insert">was loath</span> that his wicked deeds should <span class="insert">!</span> be handed down to future generations <span class="delstrike">, so he</span> <span class="insert">; so he-</span> went and destroyed , with his own hands , the chief printing-office* of the city , and scattered the types <span class="delstrike">abroad.</span> <span class="insert">abroad ;</span>
<br>
<br>* Office of the National Intelligencer.
<br>
<span class="insert"><br>Because , as he alledged , the printer had , in times past , uttered many hard things against him.
<br></span>
<br>Thus did he , even Cockburn , like an ignorant savage , stamp his own name with infamy , and make it <span class="delstrike">to</span> become a reproach amongst all mankind.
<br>
<br>Science and learning blushed at the champions of England , who had been represented as the bulwark of religion ; but who were , in reality , the supporters of idolatry ; the staff of Juggernaut , the false god of India.
<br>
<br>Now the art of printing was not known among the ancients ; for it was invented in these latter days , even in the fourteen hundred and fortieth year of the Christian era.
<br>
<br>It was the helpmate of Freedom , and when the light which it spread burst forth upon the world , it began to open the eyes of man , and to destroy the poisonous weeds that choaked the growth of Liberty.
<br>
<br>Moreover , to complete the vandalism of Cockburn and Ross , they fell upon the printed books of the great Sanhedrim.

<br>
<br>And they consumed them with fire ; thus striving to turn man back to the ages of ignorance and <span class="delstrike">darkness.</span> <span class="insert">darkness ;</span>
<br>
<br>Now , Thomas , whose <span class="delstrike">sur-name</span> <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was Jefferson , who had been a scribe in the days of Washington , and a chief governor <span class="delstrike">of</span> <span class="insert">in</span> the land of Columbia , in times past ; a man whom the people esteemed for his virtue <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span>

<br>

 <span class="insert"><br>41</span> Now Thomas was a Philosopher , and a man of great learning , and he had abundance of books of all nations , and in all languages , even ten thousand volumes.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>42</span> So the great Sanhedrim accepted the offer of Thomas , and they retain the books to this day.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>43</span> Now it came to pass , in the evening of the same day , on which the vandals of Britain set fire to the city , that the army of the king fled from the place ; for the air of Liberty <span class="insert">is</span> poison to the followers of tyrants.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>44</span> Moreover , they left some of their slain and <span class="insert">,</span> wounded behind , for they were afraid of being caught in a snare by the husbandmen of Columbia.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>45</span> So they went down to the river and gat into their vessels from whence they came.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>46</span> In the meantime , the inhabitants of Alexandria , a town which lieth to the south of the chief city , on the river <span class="insert">Potowmac</span> , in the state of Virginia ,
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>47</span> Being smitten with fear , sent to Cockburn and Ross , entreating that they might be spared , if , peradventure , they made a covenant in good faith with them , and surrendered themselves.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>48</span> And the chief captains of Britain agreed to the capitulation of the town , and to vouchsafe <span class="insert">its protection.
<br>
<br>49</span> But the people suffered for their foolish confidence ; and no one pitied them ; for it was of their own seeking.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>50</span> So it happened , after they had trusted to the faith of the servants of the king ; Gordon , a captain of the ships in the river Potomac , came up against them before the town ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>51</span> And took their merchant ships ; and compelled the people to open their store-houses , and put into the vessels their flour , even sixteen thousand barrels , and their wine <span class="insert">:</span> and their cotton , and a thousand hogsheads of the sweet-scented plant.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>52</span> So the robbers of the king took them away , sacked the town , and laughed at the people thereof , for trusting to the faith of British <span class="insert">honour.
<br>
<br>53</span> However , as they passed along down the river , with their ill-gotten treasure , lo ! the ships of Britain were assailed , and nigh being destroyed :
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>54</span> For Rogers , and Perry , and Porter , three valiant captains of the navy of Columbia , gave them hindrance and annoyed them greatly :
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>55</span> Perry and Porter raised fortifications upon the borders of the river , and put therein the destroying engines , which , when the vessels came nigh by , they let loose upon them abundantly , and wounded them in their tackling , and slew numbers of their men.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>56</span> Moreover , the balls which the engines vomited forth , were red and hot from the mouth of the fiery furnace.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>57</span> Meanwhile , Rogers sent his fire-ships among them to destroy them as they fled ; nevertheless they escaped.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>58</span> Now about this time , being the thirtieth day of the same month , Peter , whose <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was Parker , who commanded a strong ship of the king , was committing many depredations along the shores of the Chesapeake ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>59</span> So Peter essayed to go <span class="insert">, in the night-time , against some of the</span> husbandmen of Columbia , commanded by the gallant Reid ,* about the borders of the state of Maryland ;
<br>
<br>* Col. <span class="insert">Reid, of the militia.
<br>
<br>60</span> And when he had landed his men of war , he went out after the husbandmen , and the plunder ; but they were upon the watch , and fell upon him , and killed and maimed about two score , and <span class="insert">were</span> nigh making captives of them all ; and Peter was amongst the slain.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>61</span> Now when the news of the taking of the chief city of Columbia , and the sacking of Alexandria was received in Britain , at first the people rejoiced , saying , Now , forsooth , have we conquered these cunning Yankees !
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>62</span> But afterwards they became ashamed , and hid their faces ; for they had heard the judgment of the surrounding nations , by whom their vandalism was <span class="insert">condemned.*
<br>
<br>* A number of well written articles were published , not only in the papers of France and Germany , but even in England , in which this scandalous imitation of the conduct of the Goths and Vandals was very severely reprehended.</span>

<br>British <span class="delete">, under Gov.</span> Prevost , go against Plattsburgh--Com. Macdonough captures the British squadron on Lake <span class="delete">Champlain.</span>
<br>
<br>NEVERTHELESS , if difficulties and disasters befel the people of Columbia in the south , lo ! there was a wreath of laurels weaving for them in the north.
<br>
<br>2 Behold ! a mighty army of the king had assembled together at the village of Champlain , between <span class="delete">Plattsburg</span> and Montreal ; nigh unto the place where Forsyth the warrior , the second Sumter ,* was slain <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>* Sumter , a brave officer in the American <span class="delete">Revolution.</span>
<br>
<br>3 For the Prince Regent had commanded his servants to go forth into the heart of the land of <span class="delete">Columbia</span> , and separate the states of the east from the rest of the country.
<br>
<br>4 So it came to pass , about the fifth day of the ninth month , that the host of Britain appeared before the village of Plattsburgh ; which lieth about three hundred miles from New-York towards the north.
<br>
<br>5 Now Prevost , the governor of Canada , was the commander of the army ; and the number of his men of war was about fifteen thousand.
<br>
<br>6 And they began to prepare their battering rams , their bombs and their rockets , and all kinds of instruments of destruction ; and they entrenched themselves round about.
<br>
<br>7 Now the strong hold of Plattsburgh was hard by ; and the brave Macomb was the chief captain of the hold ; and the number of his men was about fifteen hundred ; being in the proportion of one Yankee to ten invincibles.
<br>
<br>8 Howsoever , the valiant husbandmen of the states of Vermont and New-York , called militia , commanded by Mooers , a man of great courage , assembled together , to assist in the defence of the place , on the borders of the river Saranac , which emptieth its waters into lake Champlain.
<br>
<br>9 In the meantime , Downie , the chief captain of the fleet of Britain upon the lake , had prepared himself to assist Prevost on a certain day <span class="delete">appointed.</span>
<br>
<br>10 When he was to come out against the fleet of Columbia , which was commanded by the gallant Macdonough.
<br>
<br>11 Accordingly , it came to pass , on the appointed day , being the eleventh of the ninth month , in the one thousand eight hundred and fourteenth year of the Christian era ,
<br>
<br>12 And three hundred and sixty-five days after Oliver had captured the king's fleet on the waters of Erie ,
<br>
<br>13 That the strong vessels of Britain appeared , with their sails spread , moving upon the bosom of lake Champlain , coming against the fleet of Columbia.
<br>
<br>14 Now it was in the morning , about the ninth hour , when Macdonough beheld the fleet of Britain sailing boldly towards him.
<br>
<br>15 And it was so , that the vessels of Columbia were safely moored in the bay of Plattsburgh , where they waited the approach of the enemy ; who were the strongest in numbers and in their engines of death.
<br>
<br>16 However , when they were about a furlong off <span class="delete">,</span> they cast their anchors , and set themselves in battle array <span class="delete">;</span> squadron against squadron.
<br>
<br>17 Now the sound of the battle-drum was heard along the lake , and the brave mariners shouted aloud for the fight.
<br>
<br>18 Then began their destroying engines to utter their voices , and it was like unto the voice of mighty thunders.
<br>
<br>19 And the same hour , the armies on the shore began the dreadful battle with their roaring engines.
<br>
<br>20 So that on the land and on the waters the fire and smoke were abundant , and the noise thereof was tremendous beyond measure.
<br>
<br>21 And the battle waxed hot , and the vessels of Downie fought bravely against the vessels of Macdonough :
<br>
<br>22 Nevertheless , the Lord of hosts favored the men of Columbia , and they overcame the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>23 For in about the space of three hours , the valiant Macdonough and his brave men , <span class="delete">made capture of</span> the whole fleet of Britain , save a few gun-boats , that made good their escape.
<br>
<br>24 Now the killed and wounded of the king's fleet , were an hundred ninety and four ; and Downie , the chief captain , was <span class="delete">among</span> the slain.
<br>
<br>25 Moreover , the number of the captives of the men of Britain was about four hundred.
<br>
<br>26 Now Macdonough was a good man , neither was he full of boasting and vain-glory : he arrogated to himself no praise on account of his success , but ascribed the victory to the pleasure of the Almighty.
<br>
<br>27 And as it is written , in the word of the Lord , DO UNTO ALL MEN AS YE WOULD THEY SHOULD DO UNTO YOU , so he took care of the prisoners , and employed skilful physicians to bind up the wounds of the maimed.
<br>
<br>28 <span class="delete">Now</span> were the children of Columbia exceedingly rejoiced ; yea , their hearts were made glad ; and they praised Macdonough for his noble deeds.
<br>
<br>29 Moreover , the great Sanhedrim honored him ; and a piece of land , which <span class="delete">overlooked</span> the lake , was given unto him , for an inheritance <span class="delete">;</span>
<br>
<br>30 That , in his old age , and when he was well stricken in years , he might <span class="delete">behold</span> with joy the strength of his youth <span class="delete">;</span> and smile upon the spot <span class="delete">where ,</span> fleet to fleet , he triumphed over the enemies of <span class="delete">freedom.</span>

<br>31 And where his children's children might point , and say , It was there the guardian angel of Columbia permitted our father to humble the pride of Britain.

<br>
<br>Battle of Plattsburgh--defeat of Sir George Prevost.
<br>
<br>NOW while Macdonough was capturing the royal fleet of Britain , upon the lake , the gallant Macomb scattered destruction amidst the army of Prevost.
<br>
<br>2 And the battle raged with great violence , and the men of Britain strove hard to pass over the river called Saranac ;
<br>
<br>3 But the men of war of Columbia , who were upon the opposite side of the water , opposed them , and slew them with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>4 And the brave Grosvenor , and Hamilton , and Riley , and the gallant Cronk , drove them back from crossing the bridges.
<br>
<br>5 Likewise , many were slain in the river , so that the waters of the Saranac were dyed with the blood of the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>6 But Macomb kept the engines at work <span class="delete">,</span> and Brooks , and Richards , and Smith , who were in the forts , displayed much valor , and caused the engines to vomit fire and smoke , and balls of heavy metal.
<br>
<br>7 Howsoever , when Prevost saw that the king's fleet was captured , he began to be disheartened , and his whole army was amazed.
<br>
<br>8 Notwithstanding this , they continued to cast their balls , and their rockets , and their bomb-shells , and their sharpnells , with all their might.
<br>
<br>9 Now these sharpnells were unknown even to the children of Columbia , for they were lately invented by the wise men of Britain.
<br>
<br>10 <span class="delete">However ,</span> the people of Columbia trusted in the strength of their arms , more than in the strength of these shells , so they used them not.
<br>
<br>11 Nevertheless , the army of the king fought hard with their battering-rams against the strong hold of Columbia , until the setting of the sun , when their noises were silenced by the brave band of Columbia.
<br>
<br>12 So the same night , Prevost , and the invincibles of the king , fled towards the strong hold of Montreal ; leaving their sick and wounded behind to the mercy of the men of Columbia ; destroying their provisions , which in their haste they could not carry away.
<br>
<br>13 And the men of Columbia followed them a little way , and slew some and made many captives.
<br>
<br>14 Thus were the men of war of Britain conquered in the north , army against army , fleet against fleet , and squadron against squadron.
<br>
<br>15 And the killed and wounded of the army of the king that day , were about a thousand men ; and about three hundred <span class="delete">,</span> who were tired of their bondage , left the service of the king ,* and joined the banners of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<br>* Deserters.
<br>
<br>16 Now Macomb received much praise for his bravery ; and his name shall be remembered by ages yet unborn.
<br>
<br>17 Moreover , he spake well of all the officers and men who fought with him.
<br>
<br>18 And Mooers , who commanded the brave husbandmen of New-York and Vermont , and Strong , the valiant chief captain of the men called volunteers , had great honor for their noble deeds.
<br>
<br>19 Likewise , Appling , and Wool , and Leonard <span class="delete">,</span> and Sproul , distinguished themselves among the brave.
<br>
<br>20 But when the news of the capture of the fleet , and the defeat of their mighty army , reached the lords of Britain , they put their fingers in their ears , that they might not hear <span class="delete">it :</span>
<br>
<br>21 Neither would they believe it ; but when they found it was so of a truth , they were enraged out of measure.
<br>
<br>22 And their wise men and their counsellors said , Lo ! we have only been trifling with these Yankees ; now let us send forth a mighty fleet and an army to overwhelm them.

<br>Battle of Plattsburgh--defeat of Sir George Prevost.
<br>
<br>NOW while Macdonough was capturing the royal fleet of Britain , upon the lake , the gallant Macomb scattered destruction amidst the army of Prevost.
<br>
<br>And the battle raged with great violence , and the men of Britain strove hard to pass over the river called Saranac ;
<br>
<br>But the men of war of Columbia , who were upon the opposite side of the water , opposed them , and slew them with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>And the brave Grosvenor , and Hamilton , and Riley , and the gallant Cronk , drove them back from crossing the bridges.
<br>
<br>Likewise , many were slain in the river , so that the waters of the Saranac were dyed with the blood of the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>But Macomb kept the engines at work <span class="delstrike">,</span> <span class="insert">;</span> and Brooks , and Richards , and Smith , who were in the forts , displayed much valor , and caused the engines to vomit fire and smoke , and balls of heavy metal.
<br>
<br>Howsoever , when Prevost saw that the king's fleet was captured , he began to be disheartened , and his whole army was amazed.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding this , they continued to cast their balls , and their rockets , and their bomb-shells , and their sharpnells , with all their might.
<br>
<br>Now these sharpnells were unknown even to the children of Columbia , for they were lately invented by the wise men of Britain.
<br>
<span class="delstrike"><br>However ,</span> <span class="insert"><br>But</span> the people of Columbia trusted in the strength of their arms , more than in the strength of these shells , so they used them not.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , the army of the king fought hard with their battering-rams <span class="insert">,</span> against the strong hold of Columbia , until the setting of the sun , when their noises were silenced by the brave band of Columbia.
<br>
<br>So the same night , Prevost , and the invincibles of the king , fled towards the strong hold of Montreal ; leaving their sick and wounded behind to the mercy of the men of Columbia ; destroying their provisions , which in their haste they could not carry away.
<br>
<br>And the men of Columbia followed them a little way , and slew some <span class="insert">,</span> and made many captives.
<br>
<br>Thus were the men of war of Britain conquered in the north , army against army , fleet against fleet , and squadron against squadron.
<br>
<br>And the killed and wounded of the army of the king that day , were about a thousand men ; and about three hundred <span class="delstrike">,</span> who were tired of their bondage , left the service of the king ,* and joined the banners of the great Sanhedrim.
<br>
<br>* Deserters.
<br>
<br>Now Macomb received much praise for his bravery ; and his name shall be remembered by ages yet unborn.
<br>
<br>Moreover , he spake well of all the officers and men who fought with him.
<br>
<br>And Mooers , who commanded the brave husbandmen of New-York and Vermont , and Strong , the valiant chief captain of the men called volunteers , had great honor for their noble deeds.
<br>
<br>Likewise , Appling , and Wool , and Leonard <span class="delstrike">,</span> and Sproul , distinguished themselves among the brave.
<br>
<br>But when the news of the capture of the fleet , and the defeat of their mighty army , reached the lords of Britain , they put their fingers in their ears , that they might not hear <span class="delstrike">it :</span> <span class="insert">it.</span>
<br>
<br>Neither would they believe it ; but when they found it was so of a truth , they were enraged out of measure.
<br>
<br>And their wise men and their counsellors said , Lo ! we have only been trifling with these Yankees ; now let us send forth a mighty fleet and an army to overwhelm them.

<br>
<br>Attack on Baltimore , by the British army , under Gen. Ross , and the fleet under Admirals Cochrane and Cockburn.
<br>
<br>NOW when Ross and Cockburn returned from their burning and pillaging , and all the barbarities they committed at Washington , the chief city , and the neighborhood thereof ;
<br>
<br>2 Emboldened by the success of their unrighteous deeds , they gathered together their army and their navy , and essayed to go against the city of Baltimore , which lieth in the state of Maryland ;
<br>
<br>3 That they might commit the like wickedness , in which they had taken so much pleasure at Hampton , Havre-de-grace , and Washington.
<br>
<br>4 But they had a mightier place than Washington to go against ; for Baltimore is a great city , containing therein about fifty thousand souls , and the people had <span class="delete">entrenched</span> it round about , and made it a strong place.
<br>
<br>5 So it came to pass , the next day after Macdonough had captured the fleet of Britain , on lake Champlain , being the twelfth day of the ninth month ,
<br>
<br>6 That their vessels and transports came to a place called North Point , which lieth at the <span class="delete">entrance</span> of the river Petapsco , about an hundred furlongs from the city , and began to put their men of war upon the shore.
<br>
<br>7 And the number of their chosen fighting men , who were landed , were about eight thousand.
<br>
<br>8 And when they were all moved out of the boats <span class="delete">,</span> Ross , the chief captain , conducted them on towards the city.
<br>
<br>9 As they moved along their instruments of war glittered in the beams of the sun ; and the waving of their squadrons was like the troubled waters of the ocean.
<br>
<br>10 However , when they came to a place called Bear Creek , lo ! the army of Columbia met them in battle array.
<br>
<br>11 For , when the gallant young men of Baltimore heard the rumor , that the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain were coming upon them ;
<br>
<br>12 With the spirit of freemen , they grasped their weapons of war in their hands , and went out to meet them without fear ; resolved to conquer or to die.*
<br>
<br>* Although it may be said the British were not conquered ; yet they were defeated.
<br>
<br>13 For well they knew , that life would be a burthen to them , when their habitations were consumed with fire ; their parents slaughtered ; and the innocence of their wives and <span class="delete">their</span> sisters violated.
<br>
<br>14 Now the name of the chief captain of the army of Columbia was Samuel , whose <span class="delete">sur-name was Smith :*</span> a valiant man , who had fought in the days of Washington <span class="delete">,</span> and gained much honor.
<br>
<br>* Gen. Smith.
<br>
<br>15 Moreover , Samuel was a man <span class="delete">well-stricken</span> in years , and he had many brave captains under him <span class="delete">;</span> even Stricker , and Stansbury , and Winder were with him.
<br>
<br>16 Now it was somewhat after the mid-day when the engines of destruction began their roaring noises :
<br>
<br>17 And the fire and smoke were vomited forth out of their mouths , so that the light of the sun was hidden by the means of the black clouds that filled the air.
<br>
<br>18 And their rockets , and all their instruments of death , which the sons of men have employed their understandings to invent , were used abundantly.
<br>
<br>19 Now the battle waxed hot , and the gallant Strieker , and his brave men , fought hard <span class="delete">;</span> and it was a dreadful fight ,
<br>
<br>20 Inasmuch as the slain and wounded of the king that day , were about four hundred ; and the loss of the men of Columbia was two hundred.
<br>
<br>21 Moreover , Ross , the chief captain of the host of Britain , was amongst the slain ; a boy , who had accompanied his father to battle , had taken dreadful aim at Ross , with his rifle , and killed him <span class="delete">;</span> And the people of Columbia grieved only because it was not Cockburn the wicked , who had fallen <span class="delete">;</span> for a man , whose name was O'Boyle , had offered five hundred pieces of silver for each of his ears.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>22</span> Nevertheless , the men of Columbia were not powerful enough to overcome the servants of the king ; so they drew back into their entrenchments , and strong holds <span class="delete">;</span> that were upon the high places round about the city.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> And Rogers , and Findley , and Harris , and Stiles were among the captains of the strong holds ; and were all faithful men.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>24</span> But it came to pass , the next day , when the men of Britain saw that the <span class="delete">children</span> of Columbia were well prepared for battle , that they were afraid to go against the strong holds.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>25</span> So in the middle of the night , which was dark and rainy , they departed from the place , and returned to their vessels , that they might escape the evil that was preparing for them.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>26</span> Moreover , they took the dead body of Ross , their chief captain , with them , and cast it into a vessel , filled with the strong waters of Jamaica ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>27</span> That the instrument of their wickedness might be preserved , and conveyed to the king , their master , and be buried in his own <span class="delete">country ; for which honor the people envied them not.
<br>
<br>28</span> Now it came to pass , in the meantime , that Cochrane , and Cockburn the wicked , the chief <span class="delete">captains</span> of the mariners of the king , sailed up the river Petapsco , towards the strong hold of Fort McHenry , to assail <span class="delete">it.
<br>
<br>29</span> Now the strong hold of McHenry lieth about fifteen furlongs from the city ; and the name of the chief captain thereof was Armistead , a man of <span class="delete">courage.
<br>
<br>30</span> And when the strong vessels of the king drew nigh unto the fort , they cast their rockets and their bomb-shells into it plentifully , and strove hard to drive the men of Columbia away.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>31</span> But the gallant Armistead let the destroying engines loose upon them <span class="delete">,</span> without mercy ; and they cast out their thunders , winged with death , among the servants of the king.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> The loud groans of their wounded floated upon the waters , with an awful horror that shocked the ear of humanity.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33</span> And it was so , that when Cockburn found he could not prevail against the strong hold , he also departed from the river , neither came they against the place any <span class="delete">more.
<br>
<br>34</span> Now when the men of Columbia heard that Ross , the chief captain of the king , was slain , and the host of Britain was compelled to flee from before the city , they were exceedingly rejoiced.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>35</span> And the brave defenders of Baltimore had great praise and honor given them throughout the land.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> And the names of those who fell in the contest , are they not written on the monument which the gratitude of the people of Baltimore erected to the memory of its defenders ?

<br>
<br>* One of the gallant defenders of Fort McHenry has celebrated this circumstance in deathless verse. His poetry is so exquisite , and his descriptions so pathetic , that we cannot resist the pleasure of presenting his stanzas to our readers.
<br>
<br>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
<br>
<br>O ! say, can you see , by the dawn's early light ,
<br>  What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,
<br>Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight ,
<br>  O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming ?
<br>And the rocket's red glare , the bombs bursting in air ,
<br>Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there ;
<br>  O ! say , does that star-spangled banner yet wave ,
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave ?
<br>On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep ,
<br>  Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes ,
<br>What is that which the breeze , o'er the towering steep ,
<br>  As it fitfully blows , half conceals , half discloses ?
<br>Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam ,
<br>In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.
<br>  'Tis the star-spangled banner , O ! long may it wave
<br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
<br>And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
<br>  That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion ,
<br>A home and a country , should leave us no more !
<br>  Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
<br>No refuge could save the hireling and slave ,
<br>From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave ,
<br>  And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave ,
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave.
<br>O ! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand ,
<br>  Between their lov'd home , and the war's desolation.
<br>Blest with vict'ry and peace , may the Heaven rescu'd land,
<br>  Praise the Power that hat made and preserv'd us a nation !
<br>Then conquer we must , when our cause it is just ,
<br>And this be our motto--" In God is our trust; "
<br>  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave.</span>
<br>
<br>Now when the men of Columbia heard that Ross , the chief captain of the king , was slain , and the host of Britain was compelled to flee from before the city , they were exceedingly rejoiced.
<br>
<br>And the brave defenders of Baltimore had great praise and honor given them throughout the land.
<br>
<br>And the names of those who fell in the contest , are they not written on the monument which the gratitude of the people of Baltimore erected to the memory of its defenders ?

<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>25</span> But it came to pass , the next day , when the men of Britain saw that the <span class="insert">men</span> of Columbia were well prepared for battle , that they were afraid to go against the strong holds.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>26</span> So in the middle of the night , which was dark and rainy , they departed from the place , and returned to their vessels , that they might escape the evil that was preparing for them.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>27</span> Moreover , they took the dead body of Ross , their chief captain , with them , and cast it into a vessel , filled with the strong waters of Jamaica ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>28</span> That the instrument of their wickedness might be preserved , and conveyed to the king , their master , and be buried in his own <span class="insert">country.
<br>
<br>29</span> Now it came to pass , in the meantime , that Cochrane , and Cockburn the wicked , the chief <span class="insert">captain ,</span> of the mariners of the king , sailed up the river Petapsco , towards the strong hold of Fort McHenry , to assail <span class="insert">it
<br>
<br>30</span> Now the strong hold of McHenry lieth about fifteen furlongs from the city ; and the name of the chief captain thereof was Armistead , a man of <span class="insert">courage : albeit , he was sick.
<br>
<br>31</span> And when the strong vessels of the king drew nigh unto the fort , they cast their rockets and their bomb-shells into it plentifully , and strove hard to drive the men of Columbia away.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>32</span> But the gallant Armistead let the destroying engines loose upon them without mercy ; and they cast out their thunders , winged with death , among the servants of the king.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>33</span> The loud groans of their wounded floated upon the waters , with an awful horror that shocked the ear of humanity.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>34</span> And it was so , that when Cockburn found he could not prevail against the strong hold , he also departed from the river , neither came they against the place any <span class="insert">more.*
<br>
<br>* One of the gallant defenders of Fort McHenry has celebrated this circumstance in deathless verse. His poetry is so exquisite , and his descriptions so pathetic , that we cannot resist the pleasure of presenting his stanzas to our readers.
<br>
<br>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
<br>
<br>O ! say, can you see , by the dawn's early light ,
<br>  What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,
<br>Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight ,
<br>  O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming ?
<br>And the rocket's red glare , the bombs bursting in air ,
<br>Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there ;
<br>  O ! say , does that star-spangled banner yet wave ,
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave ?
<br>On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep ,
<br>  Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes ,
<br>What is that which the breeze , o'er the towering steep ,
<br>  As it fitfully blows , half conceals , half discloses ?
<br>Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam ,
<br>In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.
<br>  'Tis the star-spangled banner , O ! long may it wave
<br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
<br>And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
<br>  That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion ,
<br>A home and a country , should leave us no more !
<br>  Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
<br>No refuge could save the hireling and slave ,
<br>From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave ,
<br>  And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave ,
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave.
<br>O ! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand ,
<br>  Between their lov'd home , and the war's desolation.
<br>Blest with vict'ry and peace , may the Heaven rescu'd land,
<br>  Praise the Power that hat made and preserv'd us a nation !
<br>Then conquer we must , when our cause it is just ,
<br>And this be our motto--" In God is our trust; "
<br>  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
<br>  O'er the land of the free , and the home of the brave.
<br>
<br>35</span> Now when the men of Columbia heard that Ross , the chief captain of the king , was slain , and the host of Britain was compelled to flee from before the city , they were exceedingly rejoiced.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>36</span> And the brave defenders of Baltimore had great praise and honor given them throughout the land.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>37</span> And the names of those who fell in the contest , are they not written on the monument which the gratitude of the people of Baltimore erected to the memory of its defenders ?

<br>
<br>NOW the loud and frightful noise of war sounded upon the bosom of the great deep and the shores of Columbia knew no peace.
<br>
<br>2 The dreadful clangor of arms rung upon the land , and echoed from the mountains ; and the groans of suffering victims floated in the air of heaven.
<br>
<br>3 But the Lord favored the people of Columbia , and their armies and their navy gained strength , and prosperity was showered upon them <span class="delete">;</span> the voice of war became familiar to those who <span class="delete">were</span> strangers to it in times <span class="delete">past.</span>
<br>
<br>4 Now on the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month , being in the thirty and ninth year of <span class="delete">Columbian</span> Independence ,
<br>
<br>5 It came to pass , that a certain private armed vessel of the people of Columbia , called the General Armstrong , commanded by Samuel , whose <span class="delete">sur-name was Reid</span> ,
<br>
<br>6 Had cast her anchors in the haven of Fayal , an island in the sea , which lieth towards the rising sun , about two thousand miles from the land of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>7 A place where , two score and ten years ago , there was a mighty earthquake ; and where poisonous reptiles never dwell.
<br>
<br>8 And it was about the dusk of the evening when Samuel saw a number of the strong vessels of Britain hemming him in : so he drew nigh to the shore for safety , for the place was friendly to both powers.
<br>
<br>9 Nevertheless , the boats from the vessels of the king went against Samuel to take his vessel ; but with his weapons of war he drove them off and slew numbers of them , so that they were glad to <span class="delete">return</span> to their strong ships.
<br>
<br>10 However , they quickly returned with a greater number of boats , and about four hundred men ; and Samuel saw them , and prepared to meet them.
<br>
<br>11 The silver beams of the moon danced upon the gently rolling waves of the <span class="delete">mighty deep</span> , and the sound of the oar again broke the sweet silence of night.
<br>
<br>12 But , when they came nigh the vessel of Samuel , the men of Columbia poured out destruction upon them with a plentiful hand ;
<br>
<br>13 Inasmuch as they were again compelled to depart to their strong vessels <span class="delete">,</span> with dreadful loss.
<br>
<br>14 However , about the dawning of the day , one of the strong vessels , called the Carnation , came against the vessel of Columbia , and let her destroying engines loose with great fury.
<br>
<br>15 Now Lloyd , who commanded the Plantagenet <span class="delete">,</span> Was the chief captain of the <span class="delete">squadron of the</span> king , in the place ; and he violated the law of nations.
<br>
<br>16 So when Samuel saw that the whole fleet of Britain were bent on destroying his vessel , in defiance of the plighted honor of nations , he ordered her to be sunk.
<br>
<br>17 After which he and his brave mariners deserted her , and went upon the shore ; and the servants of the king came and burnt her with fire in the neutral port of Fayal.
<br>
<br>18 Nevertheless , they received the reward of their unrighteousness , for much damage was done to their vessels , and their slain and wounded were two hundred two score and ten.
<br>
<br>19 Of the people of Columbia two only were slain and seven maimed ! !
<br>
<br>20 And the valiant deeds of Samuel gained him a name amongst the brave men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>21 Now , in the same month , the Scorpion and the Tigress , two fighting vessels of Columbia , on lake Huron , were captured by the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>22 Likewise , about this time , there were numerous other evils that befel the sons of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>23 Inasmuch as a brave captain , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Morris , was obliged to consume his ship with fire , lest she should fall into the hands of the enemy ; and she was called the Adams.*
<br>
<br>* U. S. frigate Adams.
<br>
<br>24 Now this was at a place called Castine , which was forcibly occupied by the strong ships of Britain , and lieth to the east , in the District of Maine : moreover , it became a watering place for the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>25 But when James , the chief governor , and the great Sanhedrim , knew thereof , they sent word to the governor , and offered him soldiers to drive them from the borders of Columbia ;
<br>
<br>26 But , lo ! the governor , even Caleb the <span class="delete">shittamite</span> , refused his aid , for he was afraid of the wrath of the king of Britain.*
<br>
<br>* See the letter of Sec. Monroe , and Strong's answer.
<br>
<br>27 (Now Caleb , in the Hebrew tongue , signifieth a dog ; but , verily , this dog was faithless.)
<br>
<br>28 Moreover , it came to pass , about the same time , that the strong hold of Fort Boyer , being at a place called Mobile-point , was attacked by the strong ships of Britain.
<br>
<br>29 Now Mobile had lately been the head quarters and the resting-place of the army of Jackson the brave ;
<br>
<br>30 But the enemies of Columbia had become tumultuous at a place called <span class="delete">,</span> by the Spaniards , Pensacola , whither he had departed to quell them ;
<br>
<br>31 So that the fort was defended by only a handful of men , commanded by the gallant Lawrence.
<br>
<br>32 And the names of the vessels of the king , that assailed the fort , were the Hermes , the Charon , and the Sophie , besides other fighting vessels ; which opened their fires upon the strong hold.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , Lawrence was not dismayed , although Woodbine ,* the white savage , came in his rear , with one of the destroying engines and a howitzer , an instrument of Satan , and about two hundred savages.
<br>
<br>* The celebrated Capt. Woodbine , of the British navy.
<br>
<br>34 So when Lawrence let his engines of death loose upon them , and had showered the whizzing balls amongst them for about the space of three hours , they fled.
<br>
<br>35 And the slaughter on board the ships was dreadful ; and about three hundred of the men of Britain were slain , and the Hermes was blown out of the water into the air with an awful noise.
<br>
<br>36 The loss of the people of Columbia that day <span class="delete">,</span> was four slain and five maimed.
<br>
<br>37 About this time a band of sea-robbers and pirates , who had established themselves upon the island of Barrataria , were committing great wickedness and depredations ; and were ready to assist the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>38 But a valiant man , called Daniel , <span class="delete">sur-named</span> Patterson , went against them with his small fighting vessels ,* and scattered them abroad , and took their vessels , and destroyed their petty establishment of sea-robbery.
<br>
<br>* Gun-boats.
<br>
<br>39 Now it came to pass , when Jackson heard that Pensacola , the capital of <span class="delete">West Florida</span> , had become a resting-place for the enemies of Columbia ; and that the men of Britain occupied the place <span class="delete">,</span> and had built them a strong hold therein <span class="delete">;</span>
<br>
<br>40 From whence they sent forth the weapons of war and the black dust among the savages , to destroy the people of Columbia ; and that the servants of the king of Spain were afraid to prevent the wickedness thereof ;
<br>
<br>41 Behold ! he , even Jackson , went out against the place with a band of five thousand fighting men , the brave sons of Tennessee and other parts of Columbia.
<br>
<br>42 And it was early in the morning of the seventh day of the eleventh month , when the host of Columbia appeared before the walls of Pensacola.
<br>
<br>43 And immediately Jackson sat the engines of destruction to work ; and the smoke thereof obscured the weapons of war.
<br>
<br>44 Now when the governor of the place heard the noise of the engines of death and the clashing of arms <span class="delete">,</span> he was smitten with fear ;
<br>
<br>45 Insomuch that Jackson , the chief captain , who with his army had encompassed the place , quickly compelled him to surrender the town , and beg for mercy ; which was granted unto him and his people , even the Spaniards.
<br>
<br>46 Now when the men of Britain saw this , they put the match to the black dust in their strong hold , and it rent the air with tremendous noise.
<br>
<br>47 After which they fled from the land into their strong ships , that were in the haven of Pensacola.
<br>
<br>48 And Jackson , having accomplished his <span class="delete">wishes , by intimidating the tools of British villany and murder</span> , returned with his army <span class="delete">in triumph</span> to the city of <span class="delete">New-Orleans</span> , on the second day of the twelfth month.

<br>30 But the enemies of Columbia had become tumultuous at a place called by the Spaniards , Pensacola , whither he had departed to quell them ;
<br>
<br>31 So that the fort was defended by only a handful of men , commanded by the gallant Lawrence.
<br>
<br>32 And the names of the vessels of the king , that assailed the fort , were the Hermes , the Charon , and the Sophie , besides other fighting vessels ; which opened their fires upon the strong hold.
<br>
<br>33 Nevertheless , Lawrence was not dismayed , although Woodbine ,* the white savage , came in his rear , with one of the destroying engines and a howitzer , an instrument of Satan , and about two hundred savages.
<br>
<br>* The celebrated Capt. Woodbine , of the British navy.
<br>
<br>34 So when Lawrence let his engines of death loose upon them , and had showered the whizzing balls amongst them <span class="insert">,</span> for about the space of three hours , they fled.
<br>
<br>35 And the slaughter on board the ships was dreadful ; and about three hundred of the men of Britain were slain , and the Hermes was blown out of the water into the air with an awful noise.
<br>
<br>36 The loss of the people of Columbia that day was four slain and five maimed.
<br>
<br>37 About this time a band of sea-robbers and pirates , who had established themselves upon the island of Barrataria , were committing great wickedness and depredations ; and were ready to assist the men of Britain.
<br>
<br>38 But a valiant man , called Daniel , <span class="insert">sir-named</span> Patterson , went against them with his small fighting vessels ,* and scattered them abroad , and took their vessels , and destroyed their petty establishment of sea-robbery.
<br>
<br>* Gun-boats.
<br>
<br>39 Now it came to pass , when Jackson heard that Pensacola , the capital of <span class="insert">West-Florida</span> , had become a resting-place for the enemies of Columbia ; and that the men of Britain occupied the place <span class="insert">,-</span> and had built them a strong hold therein <span class="insert">:</span>
<br>
<br>40 From whence they sent forth the weapons of war <span class="insert">,</span> and the black dust among the savages , to destroy the people of Columbia ; and that the servants of the king of Spain were afraid to prevent the wickedness thereof ;
<br>
<br>41 Behold ! he , even Jackson , went out against the place with a band of five thousand fighting men , the brave sons of Tennessee and other parts of Columbia.
<br>
<br>42 And it was early in the morning of the seventh day of the eleventh month , when the host of Columbia appeared before the walls of Pensacola.
<br>
<br>43 And immediately Jackson sat the engines of destruction to work ; and the smoke thereof obscured the weapons of war.
<br>
<br>44 Now when the governor of the place heard the noise of the engines of death and the clashing of arms he was smitten with fear ;
<br>
<br>45 Insomuch that Jackson , the chief captain , who with his army had encompassed the place , quickly compelled him to surrender the town , and beg for mercy ; which was granted unto him and his people , even the Spaniards.
<br>
<br>46 Now when the men of Britain saw this , they put the match to the black dust in their strong hold , and it rent the air with <span class="insert">a</span> tremendous noise.
<br>
<br>47 After which they fled from the land into their strong ships , that were in the haven of Pensacola.
<br>
<br>48 And Jackson , having accomplished his <span class="insert">purpose</span> , returned with his army <span class="insert">, in triumph ,</span> to the city of <span class="insert">New Orleans</span> , on the second day of the twelfth month.

<br>Steam-boats--Fulton--torpedoes--attempt to blow up the Plantagenet--kidnapping Joshua Penny.
<br>
<br>NOW it happened that , in the land of Columbia , there arose up wise and learned men , whose cunning had contrived and invented many useful things.
<br>
<br>2 Among these there appeared one whose ingenuity was exceedingly great <span class="delete">,</span> inasmuch as it astonished all the inhabitants of the earth :
<br>
<br>3 Now the name of this man was Robert , <span class="delete">sur-named Fulton ; (but</span> the cold hand of death fell upon him , and he slept with his fathers , on the twenty and third day of the second month of the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year of the Christian <span class="delete">era.)</span>
<br>
<br>4 However , the things which he brought into practice in his life time will be recorded , and his name spoken of by generations yet unborn.
<br>
<br>5 Although , like other men of genius , in these days , he was spoken of but slightly at first ; for the people said , Lo ! the man is beside himself and they laughed at him ; nevertheless , he exceeded their expectations.
<br>
<br>6 For it came to pass , that (assisted by Livingston , a man of wealth , and a lover of arts and learning) he was enabled to construct certain curious vessels , called in the vernacular tongue , steam-boats.
<br>
<br>7 Now these steam-boats were cunningly contrived <span class="delete">,</span> and had abundance of curious workmanship therein , such as surpassed the comprehension of all the wise men of the east , from the beginning to this <span class="delete">day ;</span>
<br>
<br>8 Howbeit , they were fashioned somewhat like unto the first vessel that floated <span class="delete">up on</span> the waters , which was the ark of Noah , the ninth descendant from Adam ;
<br>
<br>9 And <span class="delete">,</span> that they might heat the water which produced the steam , there was a fiery furnace placed in the midst of the vessels , and the smoke issued from the tops <span class="delete">thereof.</span>
<br>
<br>10 Moreover , they had , as it were , wheels within wheels <span class="delete">;</span> and they moved fast upon the waters <span class="delete">,</span> even against the wind and the tide.
<br>
<br>11 And they first began to move upon the great river Hudson , passing to and fro , from New-York to Albany , in the north , conveying the people hither and thither in safety.
<br>
<br>12 But when the scoffers , the enemies of Fulton , and the gainsayers , saw that the boats moved pleasantly upon the river , they began to be ashamed of their own ignorance and stupidity , and were fain to get into the boats themselves ; after which , instead of laughing , they gaped at the inventor with astonishment.
<br>
<br>13 And it came to pass , that the great Sanhedrim were pleased with the thing , inasmuch as they directed a fighting vessel of Columbia to be built after this manner.
<br>
<br>14 So a vessel was built <span class="delete">,</span> to carry the destroying engines , even a <span class="delete">steam-frigate</span> , and they called <span class="delete">her name</span> Fulton the First :
<br>
<br>15 And the length thereof was about an hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>16</span> Moreover , as they had no gophar-wood , they built the vessel partly of the locust-tree , and partly of the majestic oak that flourishes in the extensive forests of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>17</span> But it came to pass , when the wise men and the people of Britain heard of this <span class="delete">steam-frigate</span> , they were seized with astonishment and fright ; inasmuch as it became a monster in their imaginations.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>18</span> And they spake concerning it , saying , Lo ! the length of this wonder of the world , which hath been invented by these cunning Yankees , is about two hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof an hundred thirty and five cubits :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>19</span> The number of her destroying engines <span class="delete">are</span> very great ; and the weight of a ball which she vomiteth forth , is about a thousand five hundred two score and ten shekels :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>20</span> Moreover , said they , she is prepared to cast forth scalding water in showers upon the servants of the king , which will deform their countenances and spoil their beauty :
<span class="delete"><br>
<br>21</span> Likewise , they have prepared her with two-edged swords , which , by means of the steam of the vessel , issue like lightning out of her sides.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>22</span> And now , also , the cunning and witchcraft of these Yankees , these sons of Belial , these children of Beelzebub , have invented another instrument of destruction , more <span class="delete">subtle</span> than all the rest :
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> Yea , these are mighty evil things , and they are called torpedoes , which may be said to signify sleeping devils ; which come , as a thief in the night , to destroy the servants of the king ; and were contrived by that arch fiend whose name was Fulton.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>24</span> Now these wonderful torpedoes were made partly of brass and partly of iron , and were cunningly contrived with curious works , like unto a clock ; and as it were a large ball.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>25</span> And , after they were prepared , and a great quantity of the black dust put therein , they were let down into the water , nigh unto the strong ships , with intent to destroy them ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>26</span> And it was so , that when they struck against the bottom of the ship , the black dust in the torpedo would catch fire , and burst forth with tremendous roar , casting the vessel out of the waters and bursting her in twain.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>27</span> Now these torpedoes were brought into practice during the war , although the war ceased before they did that destruction to the enemies of Columbia , for which they were intended.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>28</span> However , a certain man of courage and enterprize , whose name was Mix , prepared one of the torpedoes , and put it into the waters of the <span class="delete">great</span> deep , at a place called Lyn-Haven Bay , at the mouth of the great bay of Chesapeake , nigh unto the town of Norfolk , in the state of Virginia ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> And it moved towards a strong ship of Britain , called the Plantagenet , after one of the former princes of England ; but an accident happened a little before it reached the vessel , and <span class="delete">it burst</span> asunder in the waters with a tremendous noise ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>30</span> And spouted the water up into the air , as doth the mighty whale , and the sound thereof was , as it were <span class="delete">,</span> the voice of thunder <span class="delete">,
<br>
<br>31</span> And the servants of the king were frightened horribly by the means thereof ; after which they trembled at the name <span class="delete">of</span> torpedo !--and were obliged to guard their vessels in the night , and put a double watch upon them ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>32</span> Moreover , they condemned this mode of warfare , saying : Verily , this is a foul fashion of fighting ; inasmuch as by your <span class="delete">cuning</span> ye Yankees take the advantage of us ; and the thing is new unto us.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>33</span> But they had <span class="delete">willfully</span> forgotten , that <span class="delete">,</span> in the life time of Fulton , they had offered him forty thousand pieces of gold , if he would bring these torpedoes into practice in their own country , that they might use them against the Gauls ,* <span class="delete">(with</span> whom they warred continually for more than twenty <span class="delete">years)</span> : Howbeit they proved faithless to Fulton , and so he did it not for them.
<br>
<br>* This was about the time of the Boulogne flotilla.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>34 Moreover</span> it came to pass that a certain man , a pilot , even Joshua , <span class="delete">sur-named</span> Penny , became a victim of their spite , because he attempted to go against them with the torpedoes to drive them out of the waters of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>35</span> Now Joshua lived at a place called East Hampton , being at the east end of Long Island , near Gardner's Island , opposite New London.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>36</span> And the men of Britain came to his house in the night , and stole him away , even out of his bed , and carried him on board a vessel of the king <span class="delete">,</span> called the Ramilies , from whence he was conveyed to Halifax in the province of Nova Scotia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>37</span> Now while Joshua remained in the dungeons of the king he was treated with the inhospitality of barbarians ; moreover , they strove to lead him astray : but he proved faithful to his God and to his country ; for he had known the wickedness of Britain in times past.*
<br>
<br>* Joshua Penny had been , previous to the war , impressed in the British service , and kept in it a number of years.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>38</span> However , they kept him in bondage many months , after which they suffered him to go to his own country.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>39</span> For the chief governor of the land of Columbia , and the great Sanhedrim in their wisdom had ordered two of the servants of the king to be taken and held as hostages for his safe return ; and , but for this thing , they would have hanged him <span class="delete">,</span> even as a man hangeth a dog.

<br>And <span class="insert">certain skilful men were appointed commissioners to construct this new and dreadful engine of destruction ,

<br>And Samuel , a philosopher , sir-named Mitchel , a citizen of New-York , was one of the commissioners ; also , Rutgers , and Morris , and Wolcot , and Dearborn , were other commissioners ; and they all gave their services freely for the good of their country.
<br>
<br>Now she was equipped with thirty of the engines of destruction ; and the weight of a ball that they vomited forth was about a thousand shekels.
<br>
<br>And , when the movement of the frigate was seen on the river , she was as a strong floating battery upon the waters , terrible as death.
<br>
<br>And</span> the length thereof was about an hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits :

 <span class="insert"><br>29</span> And , after they were prepared , and a great quantity of the black dust put therein , they were let down into the water , nigh unto the strong ships , with intent to destroy them ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>30</span> And it was so , that when they struck against the bottom of the ship , the black dust in the torpedo would catch fire , and burst forth with tremendous roar , casting the vessel out of the waters and bursting her in twain.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>31</span> Now these torpedoes were brought into practice during the war , although the war ceased before they did that destruction to the enemies of Columbia , for which they were intended.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>32</span> However , a certain man of courage and enterprize , whose name was Mix , prepared one of the torpedoes , and put it into the waters of the deep , at a place called Lyn-Haven Bay , at the mouth of the great bay of Chesapeake , nigh unto the town of Norfolk , in the state of Virginia ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>33</span> And it moved towards a strong ship of Britain , called the Plantagenet , after one of the former princes of England ; but an accident happened a little before it reached the vessel , and <span class="insert">burst it</span> asunder in the waters with a tremendous noise ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>34</span> And spouted the water up into the air , as doth the mighty whale , and the sound thereof was , as it were the voice of thunder <span class="insert">;
<br>
<br>35</span> And the servants of the king were frightened horribly by the means thereof ; after which they trembled at the name torpedo !--and were obliged to guard their vessels in the night , and put a double watch upon them ;
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>36</span> Moreover , they condemned this mode of warfare , saying : Verily , this is a foul fashion of fighting ; inasmuch as by your <span class="insert">cunning</span> ye Yankees take the advantage of us ; and the thing is new unto us.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>37</span> But they had <span class="insert">wilfully</span> forgotten , that in the life time of Fulton , they had offered him forty thousand pieces of gold , if he would bring these torpedoes into practice in their own country , that they might use them against the Gauls ,* <span class="insert">with</span> whom they warred continually for more than twenty <span class="insert">years</span> : Howbeit they proved faithless to Fulton , and so he did it not for them.
<br>
<br>* This was about the time of the Boulogne flotilla.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>38 Moreover ,</span> it came to pass <span class="insert">,</span> that a certain man , a pilot , even Joshua , <span class="insert">sir-named</span> Penny , became a victim of their spite , because he attempted to go against them with the torpedoes to drive them out of the waters of Columbia.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>39</span> Now Joshua lived at a place called East Hampton , being at the east end of Long Island , near Gardner's Island , opposite New London.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>40</span> And the men of Britain came to his house in the night , and stole him away , even out of his bed , and carried him on board a vessel of the king <span class="insert">;</span> called the Ramilies , from whence he was conveyed to Halifax <span class="insert">,</span> in the province of Nova Scotia.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>41</span> Now while Joshua remained in the dungeons of the king he was treated with the inhospitality of barbarians ; moreover , they strove to lead him astray : but he proved faithful to his God and to his country ; for he had known the wickedness of Britain in times past.*
<br>
<br>* Joshua Penny had been , previous to the war , impressed in the British service , and kept in it a number of years.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>43</span> However , they kept him in bondage many months , after which they suffered him to go to his own country.
<br>
 <span class="insert"><br>44</span> For the chief governor of the land of Columbia , and the great Sanhedrim <span class="insert">,</span> in their wisdom <span class="insert">,</span> had ordered two of the servants of the king to be taken and held as hostages for his safe return ; and , but for this thing , they would have hanged him even as a man hangeth a dog.

<br>Affairs in and about New-York , the first commercial city in America--working on the fortifications of Brooklyn and Haerlem--capture of the British tender Eagle , by the Yankee smack.
<br>
<br>NOW , as good sometimes cometh out of evil , so the people of New-York , a great city , which lieth at the mouth of the river Hudson , nigh the sea coast , and containeth more than an hundred thousand souls ,
<br>
<br>2 When they beheld the wickedness that was committed by the servants of the king , to the south and round about , began to bestir themselves , and prepare for the dangers with which they were likely to be encompassed :
<br>
<br>3 So it came to pass that the husbandmen from the surrounding country gathered together , and pitched their tents hard by the city.
<br>
<br>4 And the number that came to the defence of the place was about thirty thousand valiant men ; moreover there were about five thousand husbandmen from the state of <span class="delete">New-Jersey</span> ,*
<br>
<br>* The exertions of Daniel D. <span class="delete">Tompkins , governor</span> the state of N. York , at this time , will long be remembered by the people.
<br>
<br>5 Now these men were called Jersey Blues , and they were encamped partly at <span class="delete">Paulus</span> Hook , and partly at a place called the Narrows , which lieth to the south of the city about an hundred furlongs , where the destroying engines were placed in multitudes.
<br>
<br>6 And when the term of the engagement of these men of Jersey expired , they grieved only that their time was spent for nought ; for they were ready and well prepared to meet the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>7 Nevertheless , it was so that the freemen who came to the defence of the city , built strong holds and forts , and raised up fortifications in abundance , inasmuch as the whole place was as it were one camp.
<br>
<br>8 Moreover , on the tenth day of the eighth month , in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year , the inhabitants assembled together in the midst of the city , even in a place called the Park , where the Federal Hall , a superb edifice , rears its majestic front ; within the walls of which the wise men , the expounders of the law , preside , and deliberate for the benefit of the people.
<br>
<br>9 Now it was about the twelfth hour of the day when the people began to gather themselves together ; and , from the porch of the hall , the aged Willet , with the star-spangled banner of Columbia waving over his silvery head , addressed the surrounding multitude.
<br>
<br>10 And the people shouted with a loud voice , for the words of his mouth were pleasant to the sons of Liberty , and were in this wise :
<br>
<br>11 Lo ! three score and fourteen years have brought with them their bodily infirmities ; but were my strength as unimpaired as my love for my country , and that soul which still animates me , ye would not have found me in the <span class="delete">rostrum</span> , but in the midst of the battle <span class="delete">!</span> fighting against the enemies of freedom.
<br>
<br>12 Thus did he encourage the people to prepare themselves for the protection of the city.
<br>
<br>13 And certain wise men were appointed <span class="delete">,</span> by the people <span class="delete">;</span> to bring these things into operation.
<br>
<br>14 So the people began to fortify themselves and entrench the high places round about the city.
<br>
<br>15 And when they went out in its defence , to build their strong holds and to raise up their battlements <span class="delete">;</span> lo ! the steam-boats of Fulton conveyed them thither , about a thousand at a time , even towards the heights of Brooklyn in the east , and the heights of Haerlem in the north.
<br>
<br>16 The young and the old , the rich and the poor <span class="delete">,</span> went out together ; and took with them their bread and their wine ; and cast up the <span class="delete">dirt</span> for the defence of the place , freely , and without cost to the state.*
<br>
<br>* The services rendered on this occasion , by that respectable class of citizens , THE FIREMEN OF NEW-YORK , were particularly conspicuous.
<br>
<br>17 And when they went into the boats to cross over the river , there was loud shouting in the boats and on the shore.
<br>
<br>18 Moreover , as they passed along up the Hudson <span class="delete">,</span> towards the heights of Haerlem , the fair daughters of Columbia , with hearts glowing with patriotism , waved their lily hands in token of applause.
<br>
<br>19 Likewise , bands of men came from the neighbourhood round about ; even from <span class="delete">New-York</span> , and Patterson , and <span class="delete">Paulus</span> Hook , which lie in the state of <span class="delete">New-Jersey ,</span>
<br>
<br>20 They had also captains appointed over their bands ; and Abraham and David were two among the captains.*
<br>
<br>* Major <span class="delete">Goodwin</span> and Major Hunt.
<br>
<br>21 Now Abraham , with his band , came a great way , even from the town of Patterson , where the wonderful waterfalls pour headlong over the rocky mountains , reflecting in the sun a thousand brilliant <span class="delete">rainbows ,</span>
<br>
<br>22 Thus for an hundred days did the people of <span class="delete">New- York</span> prepare themselves for danger , and cast up entrenchments for many furlongs round about the city ; so that the people of Britain were afraid to go against it.*
<br>
<br>* So great was the enthusiasm of the people in contributing their personal services to the erection of fortifications on the heights of Haerlem and Brooklyn , that scarcely could an individual be found in the populous city of New-York , from hoary age to tender youth , capable of using a mattock or a spade , who did not volunteer his services in this work of patriotism. Even the Ladies were conspicuous in aiding and cheering the labours of their Fathers , their Husbands , their Brothers , and their Children. Amongst others , the numerous societies of Freemasons joined in a body , and headed by their <span class="delete">Grand-Master ,</span> who was also Mayor of the city , proceeded to Brooklyn , and assisted very spiritedly in its defence. On this occasion an elderly gentleman , one of the order , who had two sons (his only children) in the service of his country , one of them highly distinguished during the war for his wounds and his bravery , sung the following stanzas , in his own character of Mason and Father , whilst the Lodges were at refreshment :
<br>
<br>I.
<br>Hail , Children of light ! whom the Charities send
<br>  Where the bloodhounds of Britain are shortly expected ;
<br>Who , your country , your wives , your firesides to defend ,
<br>  On the summit of Brooklyn have ramparts erected :
<br>    Firm and true to the trade ,
<br>    Continue your aid ,
<br>  Till the top-stone with shouting triumphant is laid :
<br>  The free and accepted will never despair ,
<br>  Led on by their worthy Grand Master and Mayor.
<br>
<br>II.
<br>
<br>For me , whose dismissal must shortly arrive ,
<br>  To Heav'n I prefer this my fervent petition :
<span class="delete"><br>"</span> May I never America's freedom survive ,
<br>  " Nor behold her disgrac'd by a shameful submission :
<br>      " And , though righteously steel'd
<br>      " If at last she must yield ,
<br>    " May my sons do their duty , and die in the field : "
<br>  But the free and accepted will never despair ,
<br>  Led on by their worthy Grand Master and Mayor.
<br>
<br>23 Nevertheless the strong ships of war of Britain moved upon the waters of the ocean around the place in numbers , but they were afraid to approach the city ; for when they came nigh , the men of Columbia let the destroying engines loose upon them , even those that vomited forth whizzing balls , like shooting stars <span class="delete">,</span> red from the fiery furnace.
<br>
<br>24 Notwithstanding , the haughty captains of the ships of Britain would send in their boats to rob the market-men and the fishermen : howbeit , they were sometimes entrapped.
<br>
<br>25 For it came to pass , upon a certain day , that the Poictiers , a mighty ship of the king , lying at a place called Sandy-Hook , sent out one of her tenders , even the Eagle , in search of this kind of plunder :
<br>
<br>26 Whereupon , a fishing boat of Columbia , called the Yankee , under the direction of a chief captain called Lewis ,* prepared herself with a number of men to entrap the Eagle.
<br>
<br>* Commodore Lewis , commander of the flotilla in the harbor of <span class="delete">New-York.</span>
<br>
<br>27 So they took a fatted calf , a bleating lamb , and a noisy goose , and placed them upon the deck of the boat ; and when the servants of the king came nigh the Yankee , thinking they were about to be treated handsomely with the good things of the land of Columbia , their hearts were rejoiced ;
<br>
<br>28 they commanded the vessel called the Yankee to follow after them , towards the ship of the king their master ; but at this moment the men of Columbia arose up from their hiding-places in the hold of the boat , and shot into the vessel of Britain.
<br>
<br>29 At the sound of which they were so astonished , that they forgot to put the match to the black dust of the huge howitzer , a destructive engine made of brass , which they had prepared to destroy the men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>30 So they were confused , and surrendered the Eagle up to the Yankee.
<br>
<br>31 And as they came up to the city , before the Battery , which is a beautiful place to the south thereof , the thousands who were assembled there , to celebrate the Columbian Jubilee ,* rent the air with loud shouts of joy , whilst the roaring engines echoed to the skies.
<br>
<br>* American Independence.
<br>
<br>32 Thus was the lamb preserved , and the proud and cunning men of Britain outwitted with a fatted calf and a Yankee goose.

<br>22 Thus for an hundred days did the people of <span class="insert">New-York</span> prepare themselves for danger , and cast up entrenchments for many furlongs round about the city ; so that the people of Britain were afraid to go against it.*
<br>
<br>* So great was the enthusiasm of the people in contributing their personal services to the erection of fortifications on the heights of Haerlem and Brooklyn , that scarcely could an individual be found in the populous city of New-York , from hoary age to tender youth , capable of using a mattock or a spade , who did not volunteer his services in this work of patriotism. Even the Ladies were conspicuous in aiding and cheering the labours of their Fathers , their Husbands , their Brothers , and their Children. Amongst others , the numerous societies of Freemasons joined in a body , and headed by their <span class="insert">Grand-Master,**</span> who was also Mayor of the city , proceeded to Brooklyn , and assisted very spiritedly in its defence. On this occasion an elderly gentleman , one of the order , who had two sons (his only children) in the service of his country , one of them highly distinguished during the war for his wounds and his bravery , sung the following stanzas , in his own character of Mason and Father , whilst the Lodges were at refreshment :
<br>
<br>I.
<span class="insert"><br></span>
<br>Hail , Children of light ! whom the Charities send <span class="insert">,</span>
<br>  Where the bloodhounds of Britain are shortly expected ;
<br>Who , your country , your wives , your firesides to defend ,
<br>  On the summit of Brooklyn have ramparts erected :
<br>    Firm and true to the trade ,
<br>    Continue your aid ,
<br>  Till the top-stone with shouting triumphant is laid :
<br>  The free and accepted will never despair ,
<br>  Led on by their worthy Grand Master and Mayor.
<br>
<br>II.
<br>
<br>For me , whose dismissal must shortly arrive ,
<br>  To Heav'n I prefer this my fervent petition :
 <span class="insert"><br>  "</span> May I never America's freedom survive ,
<br>  " Nor behold her disgrac'd by a shameful submission :
<br>      " And , though righteously steel'd <span class="insert">,</span>
<br>      " If at last she must yield ,
<br>    " May my sons do their duty , and die in the field : "
<br>  But the free and accepted will never despair ,
<br>  Led on by their worthy Grand Master and Mayor.
<br>
<span class="insert"><br>** Hon. De Witt Clinton , now governor of the state of New-York.
<br></span>
<br>23 Nevertheless the strong ships of war of Britain moved upon the waters of the ocean around the place in numbers , but they were afraid to approach the city ; for when they came nigh , the men of Columbia let the destroying engines loose upon them , even those that vomited forth whizzing balls , like shooting stars red from the fiery furnace.
<br>
<br>24 Notwithstanding , the haughty captains of the ships of Britain would send in their boats to rob the market-men and the fishermen : howbeit , they were sometimes entrapped.
<br>
<br>25 For it came to pass , upon a certain day , that the Poictiers , a mighty ship of the king , lying at a place called Sandy-Hook , sent out one of her tenders , even the Eagle , in search of this kind of plunder :
<br>
<br>26 Whereupon , a fishing boat of Columbia , called the Yankee , under the direction of a chief captain called Lewis ,* prepared herself with a number of men to entrap the Eagle.
<br>
<br>* Commodore Lewis , commander of the flotilla in the harbor of <span class="insert">New.York--Sailing-master Percival gallantly conducted this expedition.</span>
<br>
<br>27 So they took a fatted calf , a bleating lamb , and a noisy goose , and placed them upon the deck of the boat ; and when the servants of the king came nigh the Yankee , thinking they were about to be treated handsomely with the good things of the land of Columbia , their hearts were rejoiced ;
<br>
<br>28 <span class="insert">And</span> they commanded the vessel called the Yankee to follow after them , towards the ship of the king <span class="insert">,</span> their master ; but at this moment the men of Columbia arose up from their hiding-places in the hold of the boat , and shot into the vessel of Britain.
<br>
<br>29 At the sound of which they were so astonished , that they forgot to put the match to the black dust of the huge howitzer , a destructive engine made of brass , which they had prepared to destroy the men of Columbia.
<br>
<br>30 So they were confused , and surrendered the Eagle up to the Yankee.
<br>
<br>31 And as they came up to the city , before the Battery , which is a beautiful place to the south thereof , the thousands who were assembled there , to celebrate the Columbian Jubilee ,* rent the air with loud shouts of joy , whilst the roaring engines echoed to the skies.
<br>
<br>* American Independence.
<br>
<br>32 Thus was the lamb preserved , and the proud and cunning men of Britain outwitted with a fatted calf and a Yankee goose.

<br>Affairs on the ocean--privateer Prince of Neufchatel--Marquis of Tweedale defeated in Upper Canada--Capture of the President--loss of the Sylph--Capture of the Cyane and the Levant by the Constitution--capture of the St. Lawrence--capture of the Penguin by the Hornet , captain Biddle.
<br>
<br>STILL there was no peace , and the evils of war continued on the face of the deep , and the waters thereof were encrimsoned with the blood of man.
<br>
<br>2 And it came to pass , on the eleventh day of the tenth month , in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year , that there was a sore battle fought between five barges from the Endymion , a strong ship of the king , and a privateer , called the Prince of Neufchatel , commanded by the valiant Ordonneaux , a man of Gaul.
<br>
<br>3 Moreover , the number of the men of Britain were threefold greater than the people of Columbia ; and the fight happened <span class="delete">nigh</span> a place called Nantucket , in the east , journeying towards Boston.
<br>
<br>4 Now they sat their engines to work with dreadful violence ; but in about the third part of an hour the barges of the king's ship were overcome ; and more than three score and ten of the men of Britain were slain and maimed : the loss in the privateer was six slain , and about a score wounded.
<br>
<br>5 Now this battle happened in the same month in which more than a thousand men of the warriors of Britain , commanded by the Marquis of Tweedale , were defeated at Black Creek , in Upper Canada , and driven to their strong holds by the men of Columbia , under the gallant Bissel.*
<br>
<br>* General Bissel.
<br>
<br>6 Ten days after which the steam frigate , Fulton the First , was launched forth into the waters at <span class="delete">New-York.</span>
<br>
<br>7 And it came to pass , on the fifteenth day of the first month of the next year , that one of the tall ships of Columbia fell into the hands of the servants of the king ;
<br>
<br>8 And she was called the President , after the title of the chief magistrate of the land of Columbia ; moreover , she was commanded by the gallant Decatur ,
<br>
<br>9 Who , but for an accident that befel his ship the day before ,* whilst he was moving out of the harbor of New-York , would have outsailed the fleet of Britain , and escaped , as did the brave and persevering Hull , of the Constitution , in the first year of the war.**
<br>
<br>* She was injured by grounding off <span class="delete">the</span> Hook.
<br>
<br>** Commodore Hull , in this affair , gained much applause , for his manoeuvres in escaping from the British fleet.
<br>
<br>10 Nevertheless , it was so , that Decatur was , as it were , surrounded by the ships of the king , even five of them ; so one of the vessels , called the Endymion <span class="delete">,</span> fell upon him , and Decatur fought hard against her , and would have taken her ;
<br>
<br>11 But the rest of the strong ships came down upon him , and opened their thundering engines , and compelled him to surrender his ship to the fleet of Britain.
<br>
<br>12 However it was a bloody fight ; and there fell of the men of Columbia that day twenty and four that were slain outright , and about two score and ten were maimed , after having kept the destroying engines to work about the space of three hours : howbeit , Decatur lost no honor thereby.
<br>
<br>13 Two days after this , a strong vessel of the king , called the Sylph , was cast away , in a dreadful storm , at a place called Southampton , being on <span class="delete">Long Island</span> , where more than an hundred men of Britain perished , in the dead of the night ; and the vessel parted asunder and was lost.
<br>
<br>14 Moreover , there were six of the men of Britain who survived their brethren , and were preserved on pieces of the <span class="delete">vessel</span> , until the next day , when the neighbouring people took them into their houses and nourished them ;
<br>
<br>15 And , when they were sufficiently recovered , that misfortune might not bear too heavy upon them , they were clad , and silver given to them , and they were sent to their own country , at the expense of the people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>16 (Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy , saith the scripture.)
<br>
<br>17 Now it came to pass , in these days , whilst the <span class="delete">fleets</span> of Britain captured the vessels of Columbia , when they caught them singly upon the ocean , that the single ships of Columbia began to capture the ships of Britain by pairs :
<br>
<br>18 Inasmuch as it happened on the twentieth day of the second month of the same year , that a certain strong vessel called the Constitution , commanded by the brave Stewart , fell in with two of the strong ships of the king , and compelled them both , in the space of forty minutes , to strike the red cross of Britain to the stars of Columbia.
<br>
<br>19 And the slain and wounded of the king's ships were seventy and seven ; of the men of Columbia three were slain and twelve maimed <span class="delete">;</span> and the names of the vessels of Britain were the Cyane and the Levant ; but the Levant was retaken in a neutral port ,* by two strong ships of the king.**
<br>
<br>* Porto Prava.
<br>
<br>** Acasta and Newcastle.
<br>
<br>20 Now the valiant Stewart and his brave men gat great praise for their deeds , even the great Sanhedrim of the people honored them , and gave them twenty thousand pieces of silver.
<br>
<br>21 In the same month the gallant Boyle , commanding the privateer Chasseur , captured the St. Lawrence , a fighting vessel of the king , in the fourth part of an hour.
<br>
<br>22 And the killed and wounded of the St. Lawrence were thirty and eight ; and the Chasseur had five slain and eight maimed.
<br>
<br>23 Moreover , it came to pass , on the twenty-third day of the next month , that another fighting vessel of the king , called the Penguin , was taken by the Hornet , a strong vessel of Columbia , commanded by a man of valor <span class="delete">and courage , whose sur-name</span> was Biddle.
<br>
<br>24 However , the battle was a bloody one , and the vessels kept their engines of destruction fiercely in motion , for about the space of half an hour before the flag of Britain was lowered to the stripes of Columbia.
<br>
<br>25 And the slaughter was great ; for there fell of the men of Britain two score and one <span class="delete">;</span> but the slain of Columbia <span class="delete">were</span> only one , and the maimed eleven.
<br>
<br>26 And Biddle was honored greatly for his courage :
<br>
<br>27 <span class="delete">However ,</span> this was the last sea-fight of importance , being near the close of the war.
<br>
<br>28 Now about this time the navy of Columbia had increased more than fourfold , and the fame thereof had extended to all nations.
<br>
<br>29 For , though Columbia was young , even as it were in the gristle of her youth ; yet she now began to resume the appearance <span class="delete">,</span> and display the vigor of manhood.

<br>
<br>British fleet arrives near New-Orleans--the American flotilla captured--attacks by the British upon the army of Gen. Jackson.
<br>
<br>NOW , when the lords and the counsellors , and the wise men of Britain , heard of all the tribulations that befel them in the land of Columbia , they were troubled in their minds.
<br>
<br>2 And as they had made what they called a demonstration at Baltimore , they bethought themselves of making another demonstration in the south.
<br>
<br>3 (Now the true signification , in the vernacular tongue , of <span class="delete">this mighty</span> word demonstration , had always been familiar to the children of Columbia ; but the new interpretation , although it wounded the pride of Britain , tickled the sons of Columbia ; for , as the world must think to this day , so they could only construe it , an ocular demonstration of British folly.)
<br>
<br>4 So it came to pass , that they gathered together their army and their navy , even two score and ten fighting vessels , carrying therein about twenty thousand men of war ; and the name of the chief captain of the navy was Cochrane ; and the chief captains of the army were Pakenham , Gibbs , and Keane.
<br>
<br>5 And they essayed to go against the city of New-Orleans , which lieth to the south , on the borders of the great river Mississippi , in the state of Louisiana , which was covenanted <span class="delete">,</span> in good faith , to the United States in the days when Jefferson presided as chief governor of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>6 But It came to pass , that Jackson , when he had returned from the capture of Pensacola , where he corked up the bottles of iniquity that were ready to be emptied out upon the men of Columbia ,
<br>
<br>7 Had arrived with his army at New-Orleans , he began to fortify the place , for he <span class="delete">had</span> heard it noised abroad that the king was bent upon taking the city.
<br>
<br>8 About this time , Jackson communed with Claiborne the governor , touching the matter ; and as his men of war were but few , the valiant husbandmen of Louisiana , Tennessee , Kentucky , and the Mississippi Territory , were informed of the evil , and accordingly they flocked in multitudes to the banners of Jackson.
<br>
<br>9 Now , as Jackson and Claiborne had counted upon the arrival of the strong ships of Britain , so it happened , in the latter part of the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year , that they made their appearance , even in the twelfth month of the year.
<br>
<br>10 And it was so , that when they had come as nigh as they could unto the city with their heavy ships , some of which carried an hundred of the destroying engines , they cast anchor :
<br>
<br>11 And lo , after having passed a certain dangerous place called Pass Christian , they prepared their boats , containing more than a thousand men , and sent them in great numbers against the boats of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lakes about the city.*
<br>
<br>* Lakes Borgue and Ponchartrain.
<br>
<br>12 Now these small vessels of Columbia were commanded by Thomas , a brave man , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Jones , and he gave them hindrance.
<br>
<br>13 Nevertheless , in the space of about two hours , the boats of Columbia were captured by the vessels of Britain , one after another , until they were all taken : however , the mariners of Columbia fought well , and gained great praise ; and the loss of the king was about three hundred.
<br>
<br>14 Now the capture of the gun-boats of the United States upon these waters encouraged the servants of the king , so they began to land their mighty army upon the shores of Columbia in great multitudes from their boats :
<br>
<br>15 And they pitched their tents , and cast up fortifications , and prepared to assail the strong hold of Jackson , the chief captain.
<br>
<br>16 <span class="delete">But</span> , that the host of Britain might be discomfited at the onset , Jackson went out with his army against them ; but the men of war of the king were <span class="delete">two fold</span> greater than the men of Columbia , so Jackson was unable to drive them away.
<br>
<br>17 However , he fought bravely against them , and slew numbers of them ; albeit , the slain and maimed of Columbia were about two hundred <span class="delete">, so Jackson</span> drew back to his entrenchments , and strengthened himself there.
<br>
<br>18 Now this happened on the twenty and third day of the twelfth month , in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year.
<br>
<br>19 And it came to pass , on the twenty-seventh day of the same month , that a fighting vessel of the United States , called the Caroline , commanded by Daniel , was set fire to , and blown up , by the heated balls of the king's fiery furnace.
<br>
<br>20 On the next day , the whole host of Britain gathered themselves together , and with their might went against the strong hold of Jackson.
<br>
<br>21 But Jackson let the destroying engines loose upon the <span class="delete">slaves</span> of Britain , and compelled them to return to their encampments with great loss , even an hundred and two score.
<br>
<br>22 Nevertheless , on the first day of the first month <span class="delete">,</span> of the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year , the men of war of Britain came again , and strove to dislodge the army of Jackson ; but again they were deceived , and lost about an hundred men.
<br>
<br>23 At this time there arrived to the aid of Jackson about two thousand five hundred valiant men , from the back-woods of Kentucky.
<br>
<br>24 Disappointed in their expectations , and failing in their attempts to discomfit the army of Columbia , the captains and the host of Britain arrayed themselves in their might to go against the hold of Jackson with their whole force.
<br>
<br>25 And the morning of the eighth day of the month was pitched upon , by the men of Britain , for conquering the host of Columbia , and settling themselves in the land of liberty.
<br>
<br>26 So they prepared themselves with their fascines and their scaling ladders , and their bombs and their rockets , and all the weapons of destruction that the ingenuity of Britain could invent.
<br>
<br>27 After which Pakenham , the chief captain of the host of the king , spake to the officers and the men of war that were under him , saying ,
<br>
<br>28 Be ye prepared ; for , lo ! to-morrow , at the dawning of the day , our mighty squadrons shall rush upon these Yankees , and destroy them.
<br>
<br>29 Here will we establish ourselves upon the borders of Columbia ; and ye shall be officers , <span class="delete">tythe-men</span> , and tax-gatherers , under the king , your master :
<br>
<br>30 Moreover , a day and a night shall ye plunder and riot <span class="delete">;</span> and your watch-word shall be , BEAUTY AND BOOTY !

<br>British fleet arrives near New-Orleans--the American flotilla captured--attacks by the British upon the army of Gen. Jackson.
<br>
<br>NOW , when the lords and the counsellors , and the wise men of Britain , heard of all the tribulations that befel them in the land of Columbia , they were troubled in their minds.
<br>
<br>And as they had made what they called a demonstration at Baltimore , they bethought themselves of making another demonstration in the south.
<br>
<br>(Now the true signification , in the vernacular tongue , of <span class="delstrike">this mighty</span> <span class="insert">the</span> word demonstration , had always been familiar to the children of Columbia ; but the new interpretation , although it wounded the pride of Britain , tickled the sons of Columbia ; for , as the world must think to this day , so they could only construe it , an ocular demonstration of British folly.)
<br>
<br>So it came to pass , that they gathered together their army and their navy , even two score and ten fighting vessels , carrying therein about twenty thousand men of war ; and the name of the chief captain of the navy was Cochrane ; and the chief captains of the army were Pakenham , Gibbs , and Keane.
<br>
<br>And they essayed to go against the city of New-Orleans , which lieth to the south , on the borders of the great river Mississippi , in the state of Louisiana , which was covenanted <span class="delstrike">,</span> in good faith , to the United States in the days when Jefferson presided as chief governor of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<br>But It came to pass , that Jackson , when he had returned from the capture of Pensacola , where he corked up the bottles of iniquity that were ready to be emptied out upon the men of Columbia ,
<br>
<br>Had arrived with his army at New-Orleans , he began to fortify the place , for he <span class="delstrike">had</span> heard it noised abroad that the king was bent upon taking the city.
<br>
<br>About this time , Jackson communed with Claiborne the governor , touching the matter ; and as his men of war were but few , the valiant husbandmen of Louisiana , Tennessee , Kentucky , and the Mississippi Territory , were informed of the evil , and accordingly they flocked in multitudes to the banners of Jackson.
<br>
<br>Now , as Jackson and Claiborne had counted upon the arrival of the strong ships of Britain , so it happened , in the latter part of the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year , that they made their appearance , even in the twelfth month of the year.
<br>
<br>And it was so , that when they had come as nigh as they could unto the city with their heavy ships , some of which carried an hundred of the destroying engines , they cast anchor :
<br>
<br>And lo , after having passed a certain dangerous place called Pass Christian , they prepared their boats , containing more than a thousand men , and sent them in great numbers against the boats of Columbia that were upon the waters of the lakes about the city.*
<br>
<br>* Lakes Borgue and Ponchartrain.
<br>
<br>Now these small vessels of Columbia were commanded by Thomas , a brave man , whose <span class="delstrike">sur-name</span> <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was Jones , and he gave them hindrance.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless , in the space of about two hours , the boats of Columbia were captured by the vessels of Britain , one after another , until they were all taken : however , the mariners of Columbia fought well , and <span class="insert">,</span> gained great praise ; and the loss of the king was <span class="insert">;</span> about three hundred.
<br>
<br>Now the capture of the gun-boats of the United States upon these waters encouraged the servants of the king , so they began to land their mighty army upon the shores of Columbia in great multitudes from their boats :

<br>Grand Battle of New-Orleans.
<br>
<br>NOW Pakenham , the chief captain of the host of Britain , made an end of addressing the officers and the soldiers of the king :
<br>
<br>2 And it came to pass , in the one thousand eight hundred and fifteenth year of the Christian era , in the first month of the year , and on the eighth day of the month ,
<br>
<br>3 Being on the Sabbath day , (which , as it is written in the <span class="delete">holy</span> scriptures , Thou shalt remember and keep HOLY ,)
<br>
<br>4 That the mighty army of the king , which had moved out of the strong ships of Britain , came , in their strength , to make conquest of the territory of Columbia , which lieth to the south ;
<br>
<br>5 And to place therein a princely ruler and all manner of officers , the servants of the king , even unto a tax-gatherer.
<br>
<br>6 So , early in the morning , they appeared before the camp of the men of Columbia , even the strong hold which Jackson , the chief captain , had fortified.
<br>
<br>7 Their polished steels , of fine workmanship , glittered in the sun , and the movement of their squadrons was as the waving of a wheat-field , when the south wind passeth gently over it.
<br>
<br>8 The fierceness of their coming was as the coming of a thousand untamed lions , which move majestically over the sandy deserts of Arabia.
<br>
<br>9 And the army rested upon the plains of Mac Prardies , nigh unto the cypress swamp , being distant from the city about forty and eight furlongs.
<br>
<br>10 And it was about the rising of the sun , when the battering-rams of the king began to utter their noises ; and the sound thereof was terrible as the roaring of lions , or the voice of many thunders.
<br>
<br>11 Moreover , they cast forth bombs , and Congreve rockets , weapons of destruction , which were not known in the days of Jehoshaphat.
<br>
<br>12 Nevertheless , the soul of Jackson failed him not , neither was he dismayed , for he was entrenched round about ; and when he raised his hand , he held every man's heart therein.
<br>
<br>13 And Jackson spake , and said unto his captains of fifties , and his captains of hundreds , Fear not ; we defend our lives and our liberty , and in that thing the Lord will not forsake us :
<br>
<br>14 Therefore , let every man be upon his watch ; and let the destroying engines now utter forth their thunders In abundance :
<br>
<br>15 And ye cunning back-woodsmen , who have known only to hunt the squirrel , the wolf , and the deer , now pour forth your strength upon the mighty lion , that we may not be overcome.
<br>
<br>16 And as the black dust cast upon a burning coal instantly mounteth into a flame , so was the spirit of the husbandmen of the backwoods of Columbia.
<br>
<br>17 Now the brave men from Tennessee and Kentucky set their shining rifles to work , and the destroying engines began to vomit their thunders upon the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>18 Twice did the host of Britain , in solid columns , come against the entrenchments of Jackson , and twice he drove them back.
<br>
<br>19 Moreover , Daniel the brave , who had raised up defences upon the banks of the river , likewise let his engines loose upon them , and shot into the camp of the king.
<br>
<br>20 And the men of Britain strove to scale the ramparts , and get into the strong hold of Jackson ; but the husbandmen drove them back with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>21 The fire and the smoke , and the deafning noise that sounded along the battlements , were tremendous for more than the space of two hours , when the dreadful roarings ceased , for the warriors of the king fled in confusion.
<br>
<br>22 But when the sulphureous vapors arose , behold the battle-ground was covered with the slain and <span class="delete">groaning</span> officers and soldiers of the kingdom of Great Britain !
<br>
<br>23 Humanity shuddered at the awful scene , whilst the green fields blushed.
<br>
<br>24 Seven hundred of the servants of the king were slain ; and their whole loss that day was two thousand six hundred valiant men , who had fought under Wellington , the champion of England.
<br>
<br>25 And Pakenham , the chief captain of the host of Britain , was amongst the slain ; and they served his body as they had served the body of Ross , their chief captain at the Baltimore demonstration , preserving it , in like manner , with the strong waters of Jamaica.
<br>
<br>26 Moreover , one of their chief captains , whose <span class="delete">sur-name</span> was Gibbs , was also slain , and Keane was sorely wounded <span class="delete">;</span> so that the charge of the host of Britain that remained from the slaughter , fell to a certain man whose name was Lambert.
<br>
<br>27 The loss of the army of Jackson was only seven slain and seven maimed , a circumstance unparalleled in the annals of history : howbeit , there were about two score slain and wounded upon the other side of the river.
<br>
<br>28 Now the whole loss of the king's army , from the time they came against the country of Louisiana until their departure , was about five thousand.
<br>
<br>29 After this they were discouraged , for there was but a faint hope left for them ; so they departed , and went into the strong ships of the king , with their chief captain in high spirits.
<br>
<br>30 It is written in the book of Solomon , that a fool laugheth at his own folly : now the men of Britain were not inclined to laugh , for they were sorely grieved ; and but for the fear of the laughter of others <span class="delete">,</span> would have wept outright.
<br>
<br>31 And Jackson , the chief captain of the host of Columbia , gave great praise to the gallant Coffee and Carrol , and Daniel , whose <span class="delete">sur-name was Patterson ,</span> and all the valiant men who fought on that glorious day.
<br>
<br>32 Moreover , Jackson was honored with great <span class="delete">honor</span> by the people throughout the land of Columbia ; even the great Sanhedrim were pleased with him , and exalted his name.
<br>
<br>33 And the inhabitants of New-Orleans were greatly rejoiced , and carried him through the streets of the city above the rest ; and the virgins of Columbia strewed his path with <span class="delete">roses :</span>
<br>
<br>34 For , Lo ! he had defended them from the violence of savages , who came in search of beauty and booty !
<br>
<br>35 And when the wounded of the host of Britain were brought into the city , the fair daughters of Columbia took their fine linen and bound up the wounds of the poor fainting officers and soldiers of the king , and sat bread and wine before them , to cheer their drooping spirits.
<br>
<br>36 Now again were the servants of the king disappointed ; for , as they were sent upon an evil , as well as a foolish errand , they expected not <span class="delete">mercy :</span>
<br>
<br>37 And when they saw the goodness that was showered upon them , they said , Surely ye are angels sent down from heaven to heal the wounds inflicted by the folly of nations !
<br>
<br>38 And should we again be led on to battle against your country , with propositions to violate your happiness , our swords , as by magic , shall be stayed , and drop harmless at the feet of virtue and beauty !

<br>Grand Battle of New-Orleans.
<br>
<br>NOW Pakenham , the chief captain of the host of Britain , made an end of addressing the officers and the soldiers of the king :
<br>
<br>2 And it came to pass , in the one thousand eight hundred and fifteenth year of the Christian era , in the first month of the year , and on the eighth day of the month ,
<br>
<br>3 Being on the Sabbath day , (which , as it is written in the scriptures , Thou shalt remember and keep HOLY ,)
<br>
<br>4 That the mighty army of the king , which had moved out of the strong ships of Britain , came , in their strength , to make conquest of the territory of Columbia , which lieth to the south ;
<br>
<br>5 And to place therein a princely ruler <span class="insert">,</span> and all manner of officers , the servants of the king , even unto a tax-gatherer.
<br>
<br>6 So , early in the morning , they appeared before the camp of the men of Columbia , even the strong hold which Jackson , the chief captain , had fortified.
<br>
<br>7 Their polished steels , of fine workmanship , glittered in the sun , and the movement of their squadrons was as the waving of a wheat-field , when the south wind passeth gently over it.
<br>
<br>8 The fierceness of their coming was as the coming of a thousand untamed lions , which move majestically over the sandy deserts of Arabia.
<br>
<br>9 And the army rested upon the <span class="insert">the</span> plains of Mac Prardies , nigh unto the cypress swamp , being distant from the city about forty and eight furlongs.
<br>
<br>10 And it was about the rising of the sun , when the battering-rams of the king began to utter their noises ; and the sound thereof was terrible as the roaring of lions , or the voice of many thunders.
<br>
<br>11 Moreover , they cast forth bombs , and Congreve rockets , weapons of destruction , which were not known <span class="insert">,</span> in the days of Jehoshaphat.
<br>
<br>12 Nevertheless , the soul of Jackson failed him not , neither was he dismayed , for he was entrenched round about ; and when he raised his hand , he held every man's heart therein.
<br>
<br>13 And Jackson spake , and said unto his captains of fifties , and his captains of hundreds , Fear not ; we defend our lives and our liberty , and in that thing the Lord will not forsake us :
<br>
<br>14 Therefore , let every man be upon his watch ; and let the destroying engines now utter forth their thunders In abundance :
<br>
<br>15 And ye cunning back-woodsmen , who have known only to hunt the squirrel , the wolf , and the deer , now pour forth your strength upon the mighty lion , that we may not be overcome.
<br>
<br>16 And as the black dust cast upon a burning coal instantly mounteth into a flame , so was the spirit of the husbandmen of the backwoods of Columbia.
<br>
<br>17 Now the brave men from Tennessee and Kentucky set their shining rifles to work , and the destroying engines began to vomit their thunders upon the servants of the king.
<br>
<br>18 Twice did the host of Britain , in solid columns , come against the entrenchments of Jackson , and twice he drove them back.
<br>
<br>19 Moreover , Daniel the brave , who had raised up defences upon the banks of the river , likewise let his engines loose upon them , and shot into the camp of the king.
<br>
<br>20 And the men of Britain strove to scale the ramparts , and get into the strong hold of Jackson ; but the husbandmen drove them back with great slaughter.
<br>
<br>21 The fire and the smoke , and the deafning noise that sounded along the battlements , were tremendous for more than the space of two hours , when the dreadful roarings ceased , for the warriors of the king fled in confusion.
<br>
<br>22 But when the sulphureous vapors arose , behold the battle-ground was covered with the slain and <span class="insert">the wounded</span> officers and soldiers of the kingdom of Great Britain !
<br>
<br>23 Humanity shuddered at the awful scene , whilst the green fields blushed.
<br>
<br>24 Seven hundred of the servants of the king were slain ; and their whole loss that day was two thousand six hundred valiant men , who had fought under Wellington , the champion of England.
<br>
<br>25 And Pakenham , the chief captain of the host of Britain , <span class="insert">the brother-in-law of Wellington ,</span> was amongst the slain ; and they served his body as they had served the body of Ross , their chief captain at the Baltimore demonstration , preserving it , in like manner , with the strong waters of Jamaica.
<br>
<br>26 Moreover , one of their chief captains , whose <span class="insert">sir-name</span> was Gibbs , was also slain , and Keane was sorely wounded <span class="insert">:</span> so that the charge of the host of Britain that remained from the slaughter , fell to a certain man whose name was Lambert.
<br>
<br>27 The loss of the army of Jackson was only seven slain and seven maimed , a circumstance unparalleled in the annals of history : howbeit , there were about two score slain and wounded upon the other side of the river.
<br>
<br>28 Now the whole loss of the king's army , from the time they came against the country of Louisiana until their departure , was about five thousand.
<br>
<br>29 After this they were discouraged , for there was but a faint hope left for them ; so they departed , and went into the strong ships of the king , with their chief captain in high spirits.
<br>
<br>30 It is written in the book of Solomon , that a fool laugheth at his own folly : now the men of Britain were not inclined to laugh , for they were sorely grieved ; and <span class="insert">,</span> but for the fear of the laughter of others would have wept outright.
<br>
<br>31 And Jackson , the chief captain of the host of Columbia , gave great praise to the gallant Coffee <span class="insert">,</span> and Carrol , and Daniel , whose <span class="insert">sir-name was Patterson</span> and all the valiant men who fought on that glorious day. <span class="insert">,</span>
<br>
<br>32 Moreover , Jackson was honored with great <span class="insert">honour</span> by the people throughout the land of Columbia ; even the great Sanhedrim were pleased with him , and exalted his name.
<br>
<br>33 And the inhabitants of New-Orleans were greatly rejoiced , and carried him through the streets of the city above the rest ; and the virgins of Columbia strewed his path with <span class="insert">roses.</span>
<br>
<br>34 For , Lo ! he had defended them from the violence of savages , who came in search of beauty and booty !
<br>
<br>35 And when the wounded <span class="insert">,</span> of the host of Britain <span class="insert">,</span> were brought into the city , the fair daughters of Columbia took their fine linen and bound up the wounds of the poor fainting officers and soldiers of the king , and sat bread and wine before them , to cheer their drooping spirits.
<br>
<br>36 Now again were the servants of the king disappointed ; for , as they were sent upon an evil , as well as a foolish errand , they expected not <span class="insert">mercy.</span>
<br>
<br>37 And when they saw the goodness that was showered upon them , they said , Surely ye are angels sent down from heaven to heal the wounds inflicted by the folly of nations !
<br>
<br>38 And should we again be led on to battle against your country , with propositions to violate your happiness , our swords , as by magic , shall be stayed , and drop harmless at the feet of virtue and beauty !

<br>Peace.
<br>
<br>NOW after the fleet of Britain had departed from New-Orleans in dismay , they committed many other depredations of a petty nature.
<br>
<br>2 In the mean time , Cockburn , the wicked , was busily employed in what his heart delighted <span class="delete">in</span> ; inasmuch as he carried the men of Britain against the borders of South Carolina and Georgia , and continued his system of robbery.
<br>
<br>3 And here , with the strong ships of Britain , he captured a town called St. Marys , in the state of Georgia <span class="delete">;</span> and , among other evils , he stole away the sable sons of <span class="delete">Ethiopia ,</span>
<br>
<br>4 And conveyed them to the island of Bermuda , of which the king had made him chief governor , and sold them , after promising them liberty and freedom.
<br>
<br>5 However , it came to pass <span class="delete">,</span> about this time , that the news of <span class="delete">a</span> peace being made between the nations arrived in the land of <span class="delete">Columbia :</span>
<br>
<br>6 For it had happened that the great Sanhedrim <span class="delete">,</span> in their wisdom , had sent out Henry , <span class="delete">sur-named Clay , and Russell</span> , two wise men , called , in the vernacular tongue , commissioners , to join themselves with Bayard and Gallatin , who were sent before them , to try and make peace :
<br>
<br>7 For the voice of the people of Columbia had spoken peace from the beginning ; they wished war might cease , and that the breach between the nations might be healed.
<br>
<br>8 In the mean time the king sent some of his wise men to meet the wise men of Columbia , at a place called Ghent , a town a great way off , in the country of Flanders <span class="delete">:</span>
<br>
<br>9 For it came to pass , that the generous mediation offered by the emperor of Russia was refused by the council of Britain , who had not yielded to the voice of accommodation.
<br>
<br>10 So , when the ministers of the two nations were met , they communed a long time with one another , touching the matter ;
<br>
<br>11 But the ministers of Britain raised up difficulties , and demanded certain foolish terms , which , in the Latin tongue , were written sine qua non , and which being translated into the Yankee tongue , might be said to mean neck or nothing.
<br>
<br>12 Nevertheless , in process of time , the wise men of Britain waved their demands , and agreed to the sine qua non given <span class="delete">to</span> them by the commissioners of Columbia.
<br>
<br>13 So a treaty of peace was made and signed by the commissioners of both parties , on the twenty and fourth day of the twelfth month , of the one thousand eight hundred and fourteenth year of the Christian <span class="delete">era.</span>
<br>
<br>14 And the treaty was sent to England , and confirmed by the Prince Regent , on the twenty-eighth day of the same month ; for he was tired of the war , and saw no <span class="delete">hope</span> of conquering the sons of liberty.
<br>
<br>15 After which it was sent from Britain , across the mighty deep , about three thousand miles , to receive the sanction of the free people of Columbia.
<br>
<br>16 And the great Sanhedrim of the people examined the treaty , and it was accepted and confirmed by them on the seventeenth day of the second month , in the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year.
<br>
<br>17 After which it was signed with the hand-writing of James , the chief governor of the land of Columbia , and published to the world.
<br>
<br>18 Thus was a stop put to the shedding of <span class="delete">the blood of man , the noblest work of God</span> ; and the noise of the destroying engines sunk down into silence , and every man returned to his own home in peace.
<br>
<br>19 Now when it was known for a certainty that peace was made between the nations , the people throughout the land were rejoiced beyond <span class="delete">measure ,
<br>
<br>20 (Except the wicked men , who had met at Hartford , and in their folly sent three of their scribes to the chief city , to endeavour to disturb the councils of the great Sanhedrim ; which three men , arriving there about this time , were sorely grieved that they and their employers should be held up for a laughing stock to the world ; so they sneaked away like men ashamed of their own stupidity.)
<br>
<br>21 And it came to pass ,</span> when the news <span class="delete">of peace</span> was spread abroad , <span class="delete">that</span> the temples of the Lord were opened , and the people of Columbia praised God for his goodness ; yea , they thanked him that he had strengthened their arms , and delivered them from the <span class="delete">lion's paw
<br>
<br>22</span> Thus did the children of Columbia praise the Lord in the strength of their youth , and in the days of their prosperity ; not waiting till the cold and palsied hand of age had made them feeble , and robbed their prayers of half their virtue.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>23</span> Henceforth may the nations of the earth learn wisdom : then shall peace become triumphant , and the <span class="delete">children</span> of Columbia be at rest ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>24</span> And , as it is written , their swords may be beaten into ploughshares , and their spears turned into pruning-hooks.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>25 But ,</span> nevertheless , if this war <span class="delete">,</span> like all other wars , brought evil upon the sons of men , it demonstrated to the world , that the people of Columbia were able to defend themselves , single-handed , against one of the strongest powers of Europe.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>26</span> And the mighty kings and potentates of the earth shall learn , from this example of Republican patriotism , that the people are the only " legitimate sovereigns " of the land of Columbia.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>27</span> Now the gladness of the hearts of the people of Columbia <span class="delete">,</span> at the sound of peace , was extravagant <span class="delete">;</span> inasmuch as it caused them to let loose their destroying engines , that were now become harmless , and set in motion their loud pealing bells , that sounded along the splendid arch of heaven.
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>28</span> Moreover , they made great fires and illuminations in the night time , and light was spread over the face of the land ;
<br>
<span class="delete"><br>29</span> And the beauty thereof was as if , from the blue and spangled vault of heaven , it had showered diamonds <span class="delete">;
<br>
<br>30</span> And all the nations of the earth beheld the glory of Columbia.
