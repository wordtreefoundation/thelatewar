  Joseph most likely grew up reading a school book called <i>The Late War</i> by Gilbert J. Hunt and it heavily influenced his writing of <i>The Book of Mormon</i>.
</div>


<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<div class="section">
  <p>In October 2013, the authors conducted a data analysis comparing The Book of Mormon to over 100,000 books from the pre-1830's era. Out of the top matches, we discovered a book called <a href="https://archive.org/details/latewarbetween_00hunt">The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain</a>, a scriptural style account of the War of 1812 published in New York in 1816. Between 1817 and 1819 it was marketed "for the use of schools throughout the United States" under the title <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalreader00huntgil">The Historical Reader</a>. </p>

<h3>How rare are the 4gram matches?</h3>
  
<div class="section">
  <p>While the above parallels are interesting, we believe that the more powerful connection between the two texts is the computer-aided discovery of matching, rare 4-grams.</p>

  <p>If a 4 word phrase (4-gram) showed up less than once per thousand books, we considered it to be a <i>rare 4-gram</i>. After all biblical matches were removed from the comparison, the computer algorithm found <a href="#rare-phrases">over 100 rare 4-grams</a> shared by both <i>The Book of Mormon</i> and <i>The Late War</i>. To put this into perspective, we found that <i>The Late War</i> contained more rare 4-gram connections to <i>The Book of Mormon</i> than 99.999% of the other books published before 1830. For comparison purposes, we chose an arbitrary book from Joseph Smith's time, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and compared it to <i>The Book of Mormon</i>. The comparison showed a very low number of rare 4-gram matches per 1,000 words. <i>The Late War</i>, on the other hand, scored significantly higher:</p>

<div class="section">
  While chiasmus is a pattern that shows up in many English texts, some consider it to be an important marker that differentiates modern and ancient styles of writing. We don't believe this is the case&mdash;<i>The Late War</i> contains several significant chiastic structures. For instance:

  <p>
  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a> was to Joseph Smith what 9/11 was to many of us&mdash;very real, and very recent in memory. <a href="#why-war">Why</a> does <i>The Book of Mormon</i> include so much war? Could the War of 1812 have played a part in inspiring Joseph's imagination when he wrote The Book of Mormon?</p>

  <p>
  We believe that like all creative works, The Book of Mormon is a <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/">remix</a>&mdash;it was remixed from ideas and books contemporary to Joseph. One of those books was Gilbert J. Hunt's <a href="https://archive.org/details/latewarbetween_00hunt">The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain</a>, a historical account of the War of 1812 published in New York in 1816. Between 1817 and 1819 it was marketed "for the use of schools throughout the United States" under the title <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalreader00huntgil">The Historical Reader</a>. It was a historical account of the then-recent War of 1812, written in the "scriptural style". <i>The Book of Mormon</i> is one book of several in this genre. When <i>The Late War</i> was published, Joseph would have been 12 years old.</p>

  <p>
  Interestingly, an academic in New York named Samuel Mitchill <a href="https://archive.org/stream/historicalreader00huntgil#page/n9/mode/2up">wrote a letter of endorsement</a> for Hunt's work, published in the preface of <i>The Late War</i>. Mitchill was pleased that a historian had used the "scriptural style" as a popular means of encouraging children to turn to the Holy Scriptures. When Joseph sent Martin Harris to seek endorsements for <i>The Book of Mormon</i>, one of the people he visited was the same Samuel Mitchill. Could Joseph have sought Mitchill's endorsement because of his support for <i>The Late War</i>, a book that held similarities to The Book of Mormon?</p>

  <p>
  Without a strong link between the two books, the similarities would be difficult to explain. There are <a href="#rare-phrases">over 100 rare phrases</a> that bind <i>The Book of Mormon</i> to <i>The Late War</i> (phrases that do not show up in other contemporary books&mdash;or if they do, only once or twice per thousand books). In addition, the two books use very similar language while detailing shared events and themes such as <a href="#forts">battles at forts</a> and <a href="#rivers">rivers</a>, <a href="#weapons">weapons of curious workmanship</a>, <a href="#stripling-soldiers">2,000 soldiers (including striplings)</a>, <a href="#robbers">bands of robbers</a>, <a href="#martyrs">martyrs burned</a>, <a href="#righteous-savage-indians">righteous vs. savage natives</a>, <a href="#cataclysms">cataclysmic events</a>, <a href="#columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, <a href="false-prophets">false prophets</a>, fighting for <a href="#cause-of-liberty">the cause of liberty</a>, <a href="#freemen-kingmen">freemen vs. men of the king</a>, and <a href="#brass-records">silver plates and engravings in brass</a>, among many others (and those <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithpromotingrumor/2013/10/the-book-of-mormon-and-the-late-war-direct-literary-dependence/">further documented</a> by Ryan Thomas).</p>

<h2 id="mitchill">Samuel Latham Mitchill</h2>

<div class="section">
  <img class="left" width="320" src="samuel_latham_mitchill.jpg">
  Joseph Smith probably directed Martin Harris to visit Samuel L. Mitchill, in addition to Martin's famed visit to Professor Charles Anthon. From the Palmyra Freeman, 1829:

  <blockquote>
    So blindly enthusiastic was Harris, that he took some of the characters interpreted by Smith, and went in search of some one, besides the interpreter, who was learned enough to English them; but all to whom he applied (among the number was Professor Mitchell, of New York,) happened not to be possessed of sufficient knowledge to give satisfaction! Harris returned, and set Smith to work at interpreting the Bible.
  </blockquote>

  In the preface to the 2nd and 3rd editions of Gilbert J. Hunt's <i>The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain</i>, Samuel Mitchill endorsed Hunt's book which was "written in the ancient historical style" or "scriptural style" (the description changed between editions). Mitchill wrote:

  <blockquote>
    It seems to me one of the best attempts to imitate the biblical style; and if the perusal of it can induce young persons to relish and love the sacred books whose language you have imitated, it will be the strongest of all recommendations.    
  </blockquote>

  Hunt explained his own intention as well:

  <blockquote>
    The author having adopted for the model of his style the phraseology of the best books, remarkable for its simplicity and strength, the young pupil will acquire, with the knowledge of reading, a love for the manner in which the great truths of Divine Revelation are conveyed to his understanding, and this will be an inducement to him to study the Holy Scriptures.    
  </blockquote>

  Samuel Mitchill was a strong proponent of a theory of the origins of Ancient Americans that is largely compatible with the Book of Mormon:

  <blockquote>
    Professor Samuel L. Mitchill, formerly of Columbia College, had concluded that two main groups of people once dominated the Americas&mdash;the Tartars of northern Asia and the Australasians of the Polynesian islands. Furthermore, they fought one another for many years, culminating in great battles of extermination in what later became upstate New York. This New York theory has much in common with the Book of Mormon. While visiting Professor Charles Anthon in New York in 1828, Martin Harris also met with Mitchill, an encounter that lent support to Harris's work on the Book of Mormon. &mdash; Abstract from <a href="https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/JBMRS/article/view/20211">A Nation Now Extinct</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The endorsements in <i>The Late War</i> are clearly an effort to give the book legitimacy, hence improving its marketability. Hunt is quite wise in getting the endorsement of Mitchill, who was well-known as a sort of human encyclopedia. The endorsement from Picket (also in the preface to <i>The Late War</i>) would get him into the educational market, as well. Joseph Smith may well have thought that such an endorsement from Mitchill and Anthon would legitimize the book. &mdash; <a href="http://mormonitemusings.com/2013/09/22/the-caractors-go-to-new-york/">grindael</a></p>

  <p>Ultimately, Mitchill (as well as Charles Anthon), did not endorse The Book of Mormon.</p>

<h2 id="availability">Availability to New York Students</h2>

<div class="section">
  How available was <i>The Late War</i> to students of New York? Hunt intended to sell the book to students, but did it reach his intended audience?

  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The OCLC system lists 158 copies of the book, in its various 1816-1819 editions, in libraries worldwide. Plus, there are many smaller libraries which don't participate in the OCLC system, and then there are also individual collectors. A friend of mine has several copies and sold many more, much of these in his personal collection acquired that pre-date Hofmann. &mdash; Joe Geisner
  </blockquote> 

  <p>
    It seems the book was widely available at the right time and in the right location, but did it reach Joseph Smith in particular? The probabilistic evidence for this is clear from this research; however, there is further reason to believe that Joseph had access to the book: he was closely connected to at least 3 teachers. His father, Joseph Smith Sr. was a teacher during the off season. His wife, Emma Hale Smith, was also a teacher. In addition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a>'s involvement began when as a traveling teacher he lodged with the Smiths.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another way to look at this question is, given that the War of 1812 was such a prominent historical subject, one that would have been taught and discussed at great length during Joseph Smith's teenage years, what textbook other than <i>The Late War</i> was more likely to have been used to cover this subject matter by teachers he knew?

  Both books share a striking similarity in their describing the Americas. The types of things worthy of mention are alike&mdash;metals, fruits, and animals. It's noteworthy that The Book of Mormon lists <i>European</i> animals instead of animals native to America (such as the tapir); and, oddly, in the same section that The Book of Mormon mistakenly includes elephants as native to America, <i>The Late War</i> mentions the elephant in comparison to mammoths.

<h2>Warfare</h2>

  <h3 id="forts">Battles at Forts</h3>

  The elements of the Croghan/Moroni battles are very similar, sharing phraseology and a basic plot: the protagonist men prepare for battle at their fort, the enemy attacks, the ditches around the fort are filled with the enemy's bodies, the enemy flees into the forest.
  <p>
  Some may argue that this structure is a sc&egrave;ne a faire&mdash;that this is a basic structure common to many battles; however, there are distinctive elements to these descriptions that raise the question, how could two battles separated by nearly 2,000 years be described by two different people in so similar a manner? In the context of the strong evidence of a connection between <i>The Late War</i> and <i>The Book of Mormon</i> is it reasonable to conclude that the structure is coincidental rather than imitative?

    Moroni ... had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God; yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting <b>small forts</b>, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about, to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities, and the borders of their lands;

    <p>And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain <b class="c7">with an immense slaughter</b>. Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their <b class="c3">ditches</b> by pulling down the banks of earth, <b class="c4">they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies</b>. Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain. There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe. And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain <b class="c5">they fled into the wilderness</b>.

<h3 id="casualties">Battle Casualties</h3>

<div class="section">

  Historical works describing the War of 1812 use quite a bit of variation in describing casualties. For instance:

  <blockquote>
    leaving the field strewed with the carnage of more than 2000 wounded, dead and dying" &mdash; <a href="https://archive.org/stream/historyofuniteds00but#page/364/mode/2up">History of the United States of America, published 1828</a>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The loss of Guerriere was 15 killed, 64 wounded, and 21 missing &mdash; <a href="https://archive.org/stream/cihm_47269#page/n467/mode/2up">The Annals of America, published 1829</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  It's interesting that <i>The Book of Mormon</i> doesn't include "dying" or "missing" in their battle numbers, and that they are reported, typically, as "slain", like <i>The Late War</i>. One interesting difference is that <i>The Book of Mormon</i> does not mention the "maimed", however.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Frequent reports of the number slain appear throughout the text, rather in the style of the daily reports in the Book of Mormon. And as in the Book of Mormon, near-miraculous differences can occur between casualty numbers of the wicked vs. the righteous. &mdash; Rick Grunder, Mormon Parallels
  </blockquote>

  <p>In both books:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The righteous protagonists triumph over the more numerous foe, and the enemy army consistently outnumbers the righteous protagonists. &mdash; Ryan Thomas, Direct Literary Dependence?

There are numerous references to destroying robbers in the Book of Mormon and none in the Bible. While there are no doubt other potential sources (and I wouldn't make the claim that the robbers in the Book of Mormon are solely based on this one passage) it is interesting that both the Late War and the Book of Mormon speak of going against the band of robbers and destroying them. &mdash; Hasa

  Both <i>The Late War</i> and <i>The Book of Mormon</i> share an anecdote of leaders considering a problem which has never been dealt with before.

  That they both use 'lion' isn't particularly strange since the bible is full of figurative language around the subject.

  <p>What strikes me about this is that there were actually no lions in the Americas at any time during the <i>Book of Mormon</i> period.</p>
  
  <p>So for Joseph to have used lions figuratively is anachronistic in my opinion. It makes no sense for him to have used them, it makes no sense for Jesus to have spoken to the Nephites about Lions, since they wouldn't have been familiar with them, and it makes no sense for Mormon to have used them since he wouldn't have known about them either. (Or am I wrong?)</p>

  <p>It does make sense if Joseph was being influenced by the Bible and <i>The Late War</i>. Interestingly, Joseph doesn't use 'eagle' (as does Hunt and the Bible) which wouldn't have been anachronistic in a <i>Book of Mormon</i> setting.</p>

<h2 id="tecumseh">Teancum / Tecumseh</h2>

<div class="section">
  Before this computer-aided research, many researchers such as <a href="http://www.mazeministry.com/mormonism/holley/holleymaps.htm">Vernal Holley</a> in 1992 had speculated that there was a connection between Tecumseh and Teancum since both sounded similar, and both were connected to Moravian Town/Morianton.

  FairMormon responded to the Teancum/Tecumseh parallel this way:

  <blockquote>
    <p>Teancum supposedly derived from Tecumseh...A place not named until 1912</p>

    <p>Tecumseh, the supposed origin of Teancum, requires considerable creativity to even make the words the same...</p>

    <p>But could Joseph have known about Tecumseh, Ontario? As a prophet of God, yes, but as a plagiarizer, unlikely. Tecumseh, Ontario did not get this name until 1912. ... Desperate to save this idea, other critics have suggested the town of Tecumseh, Michigan instead of the Tecumseh, Ontario, replacing a ridiculous candidate with one that is merely silly (and even further from Joseph Smith than its later Canadian cousin).</p>
  </blockquote>

  We were surprised, while reading The Late War, to discover Tecumseh and his army go to Moravian Town. In addition, their leader was slain in a similar way to Teancum. We do not believe Joseph plagiarized from The Late War, but that it may have influenced some of his wording or ideas.

<div class="section">
  Christopher Columbus was a controversial figure&mdash;was he a brutal slave master, or an inspired leader? Whatever he was, <i>The Late War</i> and <i>The Book of Mormon</i> share the same high regard for Columbus. The Late War esteems him so highly that,

  <h3>Significance</h3>
  
  <p>Not all books mention dates, but when they do they can be expressed in various formats:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fourth/4th of July</li>
      <li>July (the) 4th/fourth</li>
      <li>Fourth day of July</li>
      <li>4th day of July</li>
      <li>7/4/1830 etc.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>While it may seem odd that both books mention the same date, expressed in the same format, it's not impossible for this to show up by chance. For example the 4-gram phrase "of the seventh month" shows up numerous times in the bible which disqualified it from our initial search algorithm.</p>

  <p>However, the 4-gram, "seventh month, which is" turns out to be many times more rare than the actual date match itself. The fact that this rare 4-gram is accompanied by the exact same date makes it even more rare. This was manually discovered long after the computer algorithm had already established that The Late War was significantly connected to The Book of Mormon.</p>

  <h3>Reign of the Judges</h3>

  <p>The Reign of the Judges was a government system based on Judges that supplanted the Reign of the Kings in The Book of Mormon.</p>

  <p>This change in the Nephite government was apparently devastating to those of high birth, because they later plotted to overthrow the free government and bring back the old system of Monarchy:</p>

    <blockquote>[King-men] were desirous ... to overthrow the free government, and to establish a king over the land. And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain Chief Judge over the land, took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them: for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights, and privileges of their religion, by a free government.
    </blockquote>

  <p>Notice that the free government is the Nephite system of judges, which is supported by the freemen. The dynamics are similar in The Late War, where we find freemen fighting to maintain a free government in the Second War for American Independence against the servants of the King:</p>

    <blockquote>... they were ready and well prepared to meet the servants of the king. Nevertheless, it was so that the freemen who came to the defence of the city, built strong holds and forts, and raised up fortifications
    </blockquote>

  <h3>Counting the years of freedom from kings</h3>

  <p>It is also interesting to note that both The Book of Mormon and The Late War not only replaced the monarchy with a free government, but also used the transition as a date marker. Both books count how many years had passed since the new government had started. Notice that the wording is very similar in both books:</p>

  <p>While the 4th of July is not used in the Book of Mormon as a national holiday marking the beginning of the Reign of the Kings, it is however used in a phrase that links the two ideas--and this is consistent with our hypothesis that <i>The Late War</i> was previously read by Joseph Smith and subconsciously affected his choice of words and writing style in <i>The Book of Mormon</i>.

    <b>Engraved silver "plate" awarded to Oliver Perry</b>
  </div>

  Did <i>The Late War</i> inspire Joseph to consider brass as a storage medium for the deeds of an ancient people?

  <blockquote>
  Historical inscriptions or records engraved on brass surfaces are not mentioned in the Bible, but are highly important throughout the Book of Mormon in the brass plates of Laban. &mdash; Rick Grunder, Mormon Parallels, p. 732
  </blockquote>

  In addition to mentioning brass as a medium of record, <i>The Late War</i> refers to a "silver plate" awarded to Captain Oliver Perry from the people (the government of Pennsylvania).

<h2 id="freemen-kingmen">Freemen vs. Kingmen</h2>

<div class="section">
  The War of 1812 has also been called the "2nd War of Independence" because it settled once and for all the sovereinty of the United States of America, and separated the nation from Great Britain. During this conflict, however, the question of loyalty arose among the colonists once more&mdash;would they be true to their new and fledling nation ("freemen"), or yield to the strong ties that they had to their mother country ("Tories")? This division plays out in <i>The Book of Mormon</i> as a battle of might and will between the "freemen" and the "king-men".

  These phrases are <b>rare</b>&mdash;meaning that they are not found in other contemporary books of Joseph's time, and that they are not found in the King James Version of the bible.

  <pre>
  Topics: Book of Mormon, Translation
  Author: Gilbert J. Hunt
  Title of Book: The Late War, Between the United States and Great Britain
  Title of Article:
  Title of Periodical:
  Place of Publication: New York
  Publisher: Daniel D. Smith
  Date of Publication: 1819
  Library Location: Microfiche Z 1201.S32 Unit 179, 17184-18187
  </pre>

  <p><b>Nature of Source:</b> Grunder describes this as an "essentially naive, jingoistic, but extremely popular panoply of American virtues in the face of British wickedness in the war of 1812." However, he justifies putting it on the list because Hunt writes his book in biblical style, which, according to Grunder, illustrates "the ease with which works that sounded like the Bible could be written and marketed in the early United States."</p>

  <p><b>Comment:</b> The author admittedly tries to imitate Biblical style in his writings. He divides his book into chapters and verses and uses similar wording as the Bible. His work does not include books (like Matthew, Mark, etc.) but instead just has chapter and verse numbers. To the untrained eye, the book clearly does resemble Biblical style. However, a trained scholar in ancient texts would easily be able to pick out obvious differences. Furthermore, there is clearly a major difference in content between Hunt's book and the Book of Mormon. Joseph did not try to merely write a familiar historical event in Biblical fashion. His book was of a content never before heard, an entirely new history, and one that he claimed to be directly from God.</p>

  <b>Excerpt (pages):</b>
  <blockquote>"17 Now it was on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, in the same year, in the afterpart of the day..." (310).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"24 Now these things happened nigh unto a place called Carthagene, on the borders of Spain, and when the Spaniards beheld the skill and prowess of the people of Columbia, they were amazed" (311).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"2 But lo! When his fleet arrived there..." (315).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"39 Now it came to pass, when Jackson heard that Pensacola, the capital of west Florida, had become a resting place for the enemies of Columbia..."(263).</blockquote>

<h2 id="hebraisms">Hebraisms</h2>

<div class="section">
  The presence of hebraisms and semiticisms in The Book of Mormon is important to some scholars, as well as leaders of the LDS church, who believe the Book of Mormon is a translation of an ancient record:

  <blockquote>
    If anyone is foolish enough or misled enough to reject 531 pages of a heretofore unknown text teeming with literary and Semitic complexity without honestly attempting to account for the origin of those pages&mdash;especially without accounting for their powerful witness of Jesus Christ and the profound spiritual impact that witness has had on what is now tens of millions of readers&mdash;if that is the case, then such a person, elect or otherwise, has been deceived; and if he or she leaves this Church, it must be done by crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit. &mdash; Apostle Jeffrey R. Holland
  </blockquote>

  <p>From the FAIR wiki:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The presence of hebraisms does not prove the Book of Mormon is an ancient record, but they suggest that the translation was (at times, at least) relatively 'tight,' and require the critic to explain where Joseph Smith would have picked up such expressions in rural New York of the 1820s.
    <p>For a Semiticism to be strong evidence it must be: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>present in the Book of Mormon, but</li>
      <li>not common to Joseph's language environment (i.e., the KJV, or English of his day.)</li>

<h3 id="negative-questions">Negative Questions</h3>

<div class="section">
  <blockquote>
    In Hebrew, questions that require a yes or no answer are prefixed by ha (an interrogative particle), and negative questions are prefixed by halo (the particle plus the word for no). In contrast to a "simple question, when the questioner is wholly uncertain as to the answer to be expected," these negative questions, Hebrew scholars have pointed out, sometimes have an "exclamatory nuance" or "a special force of asseveration" (i.e., they are being used for rhetorical effect, conveying positive or even emphatic force).
    [...]
    <p>One good example of a potentially Hebrew-based negative question in the Book of Mormon comes from Helaman 9, where Nephi is accused of murdering the chief judge, Seezoram. In prophetically sending the authorities to the true assassin, Seantum, Nephi instructs them to ask Seantum, "From whence cometh this blood [on your cloak]? Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?" (Helaman 9:32). In other words, "We do indeed know that it is the blood of your brother."</p>

    When English shows a possessive or descriptive relationship between two nouns, it usually puts the possessive or descriptive noun first: the king's house or wood house. Hebrew, however, uses the opposite order: house the king (which would usually be translated house of the king) or house wood (house of wood). If the Hebrew word order is kept in the English translation, the word of must be added, even though it does not exist in the Hebrew.
